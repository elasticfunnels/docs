This guide explains how to set up Digistore24 as a merchant. The overall flow matches the generic merchant setup; use this page for platform-specific notes.

## Step 1: Create Digistore24 Merchant

1. Go to **Settings** → **Merchants** → **Add Merchant**
2. Select **Gateway**: Digistore24
3. Enter your **Vendor ID** as provided by Digistore24
4. Save

## Step 2: Assign Merchant to Domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains** → **Edit Domain**

## Step 3: Map Products

1. Go to **Settings** → **Products** → **Edit**
2. Open the **Merchant information** tab
3. Enter the **Digistore24 Product ID** for this product

## Links and Funnels

Use `[BUY]`, `[UPSELL]`, and `[DOWNSELL]` tags so links auto-adapt per domain and merchant. Avoid pasting hardcoded Digistore24 checkout URLs.

- See [Advanced Purchase Links](/products/advanced-purchase-links)

## Postbacks

Use the **Setup** modal in the **Merchants** list for up-to-date postback instructions and your unique URL. After you configure the URLs in Digistore24 and send a test (or run a test purchase), the modal will automatically mark the connection as validated once the webhook is received.

## Troubleshooting

- Wrong gateway on checkout: Verify the domain is assigned to Digistore24
- Link not working: Ensure product mapping has the correct Digistore24 Product ID
- Missing affiliate data: Confirm affiliate sync settings and use adaptive tags
