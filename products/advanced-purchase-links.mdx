The advanced purchase link system simplifies the process of adding buy buttons and links to your pages with automatic link generation and product dropdown integration.

## Enhanced Link Insertion

### Automatic Product Dropdown
Instead of manually typing product codes, you can now select products from a dropdown:

1. **Select a link element** in your page builder
2. **Click "Insert Product Purchase Link"** in the properties panel
3. **Choose from dropdown** - All defined products appear in the list
4. **Automatic link generation** - The system automatically creates the correct buy link
5. **Instant preview** - See the link format immediately

### Benefits of Dropdown Selection
- **No manual typing** - Eliminates typos in product codes
- **Visual product selection** - See product names and details
- **Automatic formatting** - Correct link syntax generated automatically
- **Consistent codes** - Ensures all links use the same product identifiers
- **Quick updates** - Change products without remembering codes

## Link Types and Formats

### Standard Purchase Links
**Generated format**: `[BUY=product_code]`
- Used for main product purchases
- Integrates with your configured payment gateway
- Automatically includes funnel settings (like CBFID)

### Upsell Links
**Generated format**: `[UPSELL=product_code]`
- Used for upsell and cross-sell offers
- Maintains purchase context from previous transaction
- Optimized for post-purchase flows

### Decline Links
**Generated format**: `[DECLINE]`
- Used for "No thanks" or decline buttons
- Automatically generated for upsell pages
- Tracks declination rates for optimization

## Product Integration

### Product Definition Requirements
Before using the dropdown system, ensure you have:
1. **Products defined** in the Products section
2. **Product codes assigned** - Each product needs a unique code
