Upsells allow you to present additional offers after a customer makes their initial purchase. ElasticFunnels supports one-click upsells that process payments instantly without redirecting customers to a checkout page.

## How Upsells Work

After a customer completes their initial purchase, they're redirected through your funnel flow. Upsell pages present additional offers that customers can accept or decline:

1. **Customer purchases main product** → Redirected to upsell page
2. **Upsell page displays** → Customer sees additional offer
3. **Customer accepts or declines** → Flow continues to next step or thank you page

### One-Click Upsells vs Checkout Redirect

The tag you use determines the customer experience:

| Tag | Behavior | When to Use |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `[UPSELL=]` or `[DOWNSELL=]` | **One-click purchase** - No checkout page, payment processed instantly | Post-purchase upsell pages (customer already has an active purchase session) |
| `[BUY=]` | **Redirect to checkout** - Customer goes to merchant checkout page | Main sales pages, or when there's no active purchase session |

<Note>
**Important:** One-click upsells require an active purchase session. If the customer doesn't have an active session (e.g., they navigated directly to an upsell page), clicking an `[UPSELL=]` link will redirect them to the checkout page instead.
</Note>

## Setting Up Upsell Pages

### Step 1: Create Your Upsell Page

1. Go to **Pages** → **Create New Page**
2. Design your upsell offer page with:
   - Clear value proposition
   - Product benefits
   - Accept button (upsell link)
   - Decline button (decline link)

### Step 2: Add Upsell Links

Use these tags in your page links:

#### Accept Upsell Button
```
[UPSELL=your_product_code]
```

#### Decline Button
```
[UPSELL_DECLINE]
```

You can also specify a product for the decline (useful for downsells):
```
[UPSELL_DECLINE=downsell_product_code]
```

### Step 3: Configure Funnel Flow

Each page node in the funnel builder has built-in **On Purchase** and **On Decline** connection points.

1. Open your funnel in the builder
2. Add a **Page node** for your upsell page
3. The page node automatically shows **On Purchase** and **On Decline** connections
4. Connect **On Purchase** to the next step (another page, redirect, split test, etc.)
5. Connect **On Decline** to a downsell page or thank you page

**Example Flow:**
```
Upsell Page (6 Bottles)
    ├── On Purchase → Thank You Page
    └── On Decline → Downsell Page (3 Bottles)
                         ├── On Purchase → Thank You Page
                         └── On Decline → Thank You Page
```

### Available Nodes After Purchase/Decline

After the On Purchase or On Decline connection, you can add:

- **Go to Page** - Navigate to another page in your funnel
- **Redirect to URL** - Redirect to an external URL
- **Split Test** - A/B test different paths
- **Product Check** - Check which product was purchased
- **Script Rule** - Apply conditional logic
- **Tag User** - Add tags to the customer
- **Whitelist visitor** - Mark visitor as whitelisted
- **Is Whitelisted?** - Check if visitor is whitelisted
- **Has Tag** - Check if user has a specific tag
- **Is Test Order?** - Check if this is a test transaction

## Upsell Link Tags

### Basic Upsell
```
[UPSELL=product_code]
```
Processes the upsell purchase and continues the funnel flow.

### Downsell
```
[DOWNSELL=product_code]
```
Works the same as `[UPSELL]` but allows you to semantically differentiate downsell offers in your tracking and analytics.

### Decline Link
```
[UPSELL_DECLINE]
```
Skips the current upsell and proceeds to the next funnel step (either another upsell or the thank you page).

### Decline with Downsell Tracking
```
[UPSELL_DECLINE=product_code]
```
Declines the current offer but tracks which product was declined for analytics.

### With Extra Parameters
```
[UPSELL=product_code extra=campaign_data]
```

## Funnel Node Configuration

### Using Copy Node URL

For ClickBank, Buygoods, and Digistore24, you need to configure redirect URLs in the merchant's platform (pitch flow settings).

Each **On Purchase** and **On Decline** node has a **Copy Node URL** button:

1. In your funnel builder, locate the **On Purchase** or **On Decline** node
2. Click the **Copy Node URL** button
3. Paste this URL into your merchant's pitch flow or redirect settings

This decouples your funnel from specific page URLs, allowing you to:
- Split test different upsell pages without changing merchant settings
- Swap pages without re-approval from the merchant
- Maintain consistent tracking across page changes

<Warning>
Always use Copy Node URL when configuring your merchant's pitch flow. Direct page URLs will break if you rename or replace pages.
</Warning>

## How One-Click Upsells Work

When a customer has an active purchase session:

1. **Customer clicks `[UPSELL=]` button** → Payment processed by the merchant (ClickBank, Buygoods, or Digistore24)
2. **No checkout page shown** → Customer stays in the funnel flow
3. **Automatic redirect** → Customer proceeds to the next funnel step

### Session Requirements

For one-click upsells to work:
- Customer must have completed a purchase in the current session
- The purchase session must still be active
- The upsell must be part of the same funnel flow

<Note>
Use **Copy Node URL** in your funnel builder to get the correct redirect URLs for configuring your merchant's pitch flow settings.
</Note>

## Types of Upsells

### One-Click Upsell
- Post-purchase offer using `[UPSELL=product_code]` tag
- Customer can purchase with one click
- No checkout page - payment processed instantly
- Requires active purchase session

### Downsell
- Lower-priced alternative shown when upsell is declined
- Uses `[DOWNSELL=product_code]` tag
- Helps recover potential lost sales
- Often a scaled-down version of the upsell
- Can be chained: Upsell → Decline → Downsell → Decline → Thank You

## Upsell Page Best Practices

### Essential Elements
- **Clear value proposition**: Why they need this additional product
- **Urgency**: Limited time or quantity offers
- **Social proof**: Testimonials specific to the upsell
- **Simple checkout**: One clear "Yes" button, one clear "No Thanks" button

### Content Strategy
- **Complement the main purchase**: Related but distinct value
- **Address remaining pain points**: Solve additional problems
- **Show before/after scenarios**: Demonstrate the enhanced outcome
- **Use purchase confirmation**: "Since you just purchased X, you qualify for Y"

### Button Placement
```html
<!-- Accept button - make it prominent -->
<a href="[UPSELL=premium_package]" class="btn-accept">
  Yes! Add This To My Order
</a>

<!-- Decline button - clear but less prominent -->
<a href="[UPSELL_DECLINE]" class="btn-decline">
  No thanks, I'll pass on this offer
</a>
```

## Advanced Upsell Strategies

### Sequential Upsells
Chain multiple upsell offers:
```
Main Sale → Upsell 1 ($97) → Upsell 2 ($47) → Downsell ($27) → Thank You
```

### Conditional Upsells
Use Page Events to show different upsells based on:
- Original purchase amount
- Customer location
- Traffic source
- Previous purchase history

### Tracking Accepted Upsells
Use the `accepted_upsells` variable in Script Rules to customize content based on whether the customer has accepted any upsells:

```javascript
// In a Script Rule condition
customer.accepted_upsells === true
```

## Measuring Upsell Performance

### Key Metrics
- **Upsell take rate**: Percentage who accept each upsell
- **Average order value (AOV)**: Total revenue including upsells
- **Revenue per visitor (RPV)**: Lifetime value impact
- **Decline rate**: How many skip each offer

### Optimization Tips
- A/B test different upsell offers and pricing
- Test upsell page designs and copy
- Experiment with the number of upsells in a sequence
- Monitor customer satisfaction (too many upsells can harm brand)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Upsell link not working:**
- Verify the product code matches exactly
- Check that the product exists in your Products list
- Ensure the product has the correct merchant mapping

**One-click not processing:**
- Verify you're using `[UPSELL=]` or `[DOWNSELL=]` tags (not `[BUY=]`)
- Check that session data is preserved (cookies enabled)
- Ensure the main sale completed successfully
- Customer must have an active purchase session

**Redirect failing after purchase/decline:**
- Verify Copy Node URL was used correctly in merchant pitch flow
- Check merchant pitch flow configuration
- Ensure redirect URLs are properly URL-encoded

**Wrong page showing after purchase/decline:**
- Check funnel node connections
- Verify Purchase and Decline nodes point to correct pages
- Test the full flow from main sale to thank you page

### Testing Your Upsells
1. Complete a test purchase through the main sale
2. Verify upsell page loads correctly
3. Test both accept and decline paths
4. Confirm correct pages display at each step
5. Verify payments process correctly (use test mode)

<Note>
For ClickBank, Buygoods, and Digistore24, use the platform's test mode or sandbox environment to verify the complete flow without processing real payments.
