Redirecting users to an upsell page after purchase allows you to present additional offers or upgrades.

## Set Up Upsell Redirect

### Step 1: Locate Purchase Node
1. In your funnel builder, locate the page node where the purchase will occur
2. Add a "Purchase" node to the page node

### Step 2: Configure Redirect
1. After adding it, use a "Page" node to select an upsell page or a "Redirect to URL" node to enter the upsell URL
2. Connect the "Purchase" node to the next step

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Save your funnel and perform a test purchase to ensure redirection works as expected
