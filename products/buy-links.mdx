Buy links let customers purchase products directly from your page.

## Add a Product

### Step 1: Create Product
1. Go to "Products" → "Add Product"
2. Fill out all necessary information and define a product code
3. Include cost of goods if you want reporting

### Step 2: Embedding the Buy Link
1. Create a link tag and insert `[BUY=product_code]` or `[UPSELL=product_code]`
2. You can pass more data, e.g., `[BUY=product_code extra=abcd]`

### Step 3: Merchant Information
1. If you have a different code on Buygoods, Clickbank, or Digistore24, go to the "Merchant Information" tab
2. Associate the correct product ID from that platform

## Buy Link Formats

### Basic Buy Link
```
[BUY=your_product_code]
```

### Upsell Link
```
[UPSELL=your_product_code]
```

### Advanced Parameters
```
[BUY=product_code extra=campaign_data]
```

## Parameter Options

### Standard Parameters
- **extra**: Additional tracking data
- **quantity**: Pre-set purchase quantity
- **discount**: Apply discount codes

### Platform-Specific Affiliate Parameters
Affiliate parameters are typically passed via URL query strings to the landing page, not in buy links. The system automatically captures and tracks them:

- **ClickBank**: `hop` or `affiliate` (affiliate ID), `tid` (tracking ID/sub-affiliate)
- **Buygoods**: `aff_id` (affiliate ID), `subid` (sub-affiliate tracking)
- **Digistore24**: `aff` (affiliate ID)

<Note>
**CBFID** (ClickBank Pitch Flow ID) is configured at the funnel level and automatically included in purchase links. You don't need to add it manually to buy links.
