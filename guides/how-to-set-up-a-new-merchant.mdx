This guide walks you through publishing an offer with a new merchant end-to-end. The flow is the same for all supported merchants (Buygoods, ClickBank, Digistore24, Shopify Checkout, Shop Pay). Platform-specific extras are linked where needed.

<Warning>
A domain can have only one merchant assigned at a time. Changing a domain's merchant affects all auto-generated buy links on that domain.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Create the merchant

1. Go to **Settings** → **Merchants**
2. Click **Add Merchant**
3. Select a **Gateway** (e.g., Buygoods, ClickBank, Digistore24)
4. Enter your **Account ID** (as required by the gateway)
5. Optional toggles:
   - **Sync Affiliates Locally**: Keep affiliate data mirrored in your account
   - **Use Direct Links**: Use gateway-provided direct links when supported
6. Click **Save**

<Note>
For ClickBank merchants, you must also create a Pitch Flow in ClickBank. See [ClickBank Merchant Setup](/merchants/clickbank#step-3-set-up-clickbank-pitch-flow). For Shopify Checkout or Shop Pay, see [Shopify Checkout](/merchants/shopify-checkout) and [Shop Pay](/merchants/shop-pay) for setup and product mapping.
</Note>

## Step 2: Assign the merchant to a domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Edit the target domain
3. Choose your new merchant in **Merchant**
4. Save

This assignment makes the domain use that merchant for checkout and postbacks.

## Step 3: Map products to the merchant

1. Go to **Settings** → **Products**
2. Open a product and go to the **Merchant information** tab
3. Enter the platform-specific Product ID (e.g., Buygoods product ID, ClickBank product ID)
4. Click **Save**

<Note>
Product mapping is one-merchant-per-product. Repeat for each product you plan to sell with this merchant.
</Note>

## Step 4: Connect or create your funnel

You have two options:

- Assign an existing funnel to the domain and (optionally) set it as the default funnel.
- Or create a new funnel for this domain.

See:
- [Create Funnel](/funnels/create-funnel)
- [Checkout Redirect Behavior](/funnels/checkout-redirect-behavior)

If you have multiple funnels on the same domain, copy the funnel link from the funnel list. This adds the `?f={funnel_code}` parameter to ensure the correct funnel runs.

## Step 5: Use adaptive purchase links

Use editor tags so links adapt automatically to the current domain's merchant and your product mapping:

- `[BUY=product_code]`
- `[UPSELL=product_code]`
- `[DOWNSELL=product_code]`

These automatically resolve to the correct gateway links for the assigned merchant on the active domain.

<Warning>
Hardcoded external checkout URLs (e.g., pasted Buygoods/ClickBank links) will not be adapted. Use the tags above instead. See [Buy Links](/products/buy-links) and [Advanced Purchase Links](/products/advanced-purchase-links).
</Warning>

## Testing and debugging

1. Test buy links on the assigned domain and confirm the correct checkout gateway opens
2. Complete a test purchase and verify the intended funnel flow executes
3. Open the **Debug Window** with `Ctrl + Shift + F12` to inspect domain, funnel, and merchant resolution
4. Verify postbacks and analytics update as expected

### Postback setup and validation

Use the **Setup** modal from the **Merchants** list for gateway-specific postback instructions and your unique URL. After you configure the postback in the merchant platform (Buygoods, ClickBank, Digistore24) and trigger a test event, the modal automatically updates to show validation status when the webhook is received.

Recommended ways to trigger validation:

- Use the merchant's built-in "Send Test" feature (where available)
- Or perform a low-value test purchase

### Quick checklist

- [ ] Merchant created in **Settings** → **Merchants**
- [ ] Domain assigned to the merchant in **Settings** → **Domains**
- [ ] Each product mapped in the product's **Merchant information** tab
- [ ] Funnel associated with the domain; default set if desired
- [ ] Links use `[BUY]`, `[UPSELL]`, or `[DOWNSELL]` tags (not hardcoded URLs)
- [ ] Test purchase completes and the correct flow runs

<Note>
If you add new pages for a specific funnel or merchant, make sure they are added to the funnel flow. Otherwise, they might not trigger the customer flow.
