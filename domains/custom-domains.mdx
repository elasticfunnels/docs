Using a custom domain provides a branded URL and increases user trust through SSL encryption.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Domain
1. Go to the "Domains" section in your dashboard
2. Click "Add Domain" and switch to "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., example.com)

### Step 2: SSL Configuration
1. If you need SSL now, check "I want SSL for this domain"
2. If not, request SSL later from the domains list by clicking the options button and selecting "Request SSL" once the domain is validated

### Step 3: Merchant Association
1. Associate the domain with a merchant to automatically update buy links (e.g., Buygoods, Clickbank, Digistore24)
2. Optionally, add reCAPTCHA site and private key for collection forms

### Step 4: DNS Setup
1. Update your DNS with the required A record and TXT record for validation. Both must be added
2. You'll receive an email once validated. If you encounter issues, email support

## DNS Configuration

### Required Records
- **A Record**: Points your domain to our servers
- **TXT Record**: Validates domain ownership

### Common DNS Providers
- **Cloudflare**: DNS management with additional CDN benefits
- **GoDaddy**: Simple DNS interface for basic setup
- **Namecheap**: User-friendly DNS management
- **Google Domains**: Clean interface with Google integration

## SSL Certificate Benefits

### Security Features
- **Encrypted Communication**: Protects user data in transit
- **Authentication**: Verifies your site's identity
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures data isn't modified during transfer

### SEO & Trust Benefits
- **Google Ranking**: SSL is a ranking factor
- **User Trust**: Browsers show security indicators
- **Conversion Boost**: Users more likely to purchase on secure sites

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Domain Not Validating
- Double-check DNS records are correctly entered
- Allow 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Verify you have access to modify DNS settings
- Contact your DNS provider if records aren't updating

### SSL Certificate Problems
- Ensure domain is fully validated before requesting SSL
- Check for mixed content issues (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Verify all subdomains are covered by the certificate

### Buy Link Issues
- Confirm merchant association is properly configured
- Test buy links after domain setup
- Verify affiliate tracking still works with custom domain
- Check payment processor domain whitelist settings

## Best Practices

### Domain Selection
- Choose brandable, memorable domain names
- Avoid hyphens and numbers if possible
- Consider multiple domain extensions (.com, .net, etc.)
- Check trademark conflicts before purchasing

### Security Maintenance
- Enable automatic SSL renewal
- Regularly monitor certificate expiration dates
- Keep DNS records updated and documented
- Use strong authentication for domain registrar accounts

### Performance Optimization
- Use CDN services for global performance
- Enable GZIP compression at domain level
- Implement proper caching headers
- Monitor site speed and uptime regularly
