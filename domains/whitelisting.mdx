Domain-level whitelisting allows you to automatically whitelist all visitors to a specific domain, ensuring they see your full content without requiring URL parameters or other conditions.

## Understanding Domain-Level Whitelisting

When you enable domain-level whitelisting, **all visitors** to that specific domain are automatically whitelisted for their entire session. This means they will see content in **Whitelisted Containers** by default, without needing query parameters or other whitelisting conditions.

### How It Works
- **Automatic whitelisting** - No URL parameters needed
- **Domain-specific** - Only applies to the configured domain
- **Session-wide** - Applies to all pages within that domain
- **Immediate effect** - Takes effect as soon as visitors land on the domain

## Setting Up Domain-Level Whitelisting

### Step 1: Access Domain Settings
1. Go to **Domains** in your ElasticFunnels.io dashboard
2. Find the domain you want to configure
3. Click **"Edit"** on that domain

### Step 2: Enable Whitelisting
1. In the domain settings, look for **"Whitelist all visitors"** option
2. **Toggle it ON** to enable automatic whitelisting
3. **Save** your domain configuration

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
- **Enabled**: All visitors to this domain will see full content
- **Disabled**: Visitors will see compliant content (unless whitelisted by other methods)

## When to Use Domain-Level Whitelisting

### Separate Domains Strategy
**Best use case**: When you have separate domains for different purposes:
- **Compliant domain** (e.g., `example-compliant.com`) - For ad platform review
- **Full content domain** (e.g., `example-full.com`) - For actual traffic

### Traffic Segmentation
Use domain-level whitelisting when you want to:
- **Direct real traffic** to a specific domain
- **Separate compliance review** from actual customer traffic
- **Simplify visitor experience** - no need for complex URL parameters
- **Ensure consistent experience** across all pages on that domain

### Campaign-Specific Domains
Perfect for:
- **VIP campaigns** with dedicated domains
- **Affiliate-specific domains** for different partners
- **Geographic targeting** with country-specific domains
- **Product-specific domains** for different offers

## Integration with Other Whitelisting Methods

### Priority Order
When multiple whitelisting methods are configured:
1. **Domain-level whitelisting** (highest priority)
2. **Query parameter whitelisting**
3. **Page event whitelisting**
4. **Default non-whitelisted state**

### Combined Strategies
You can combine domain-level whitelisting with:
- **Query parameter conditions** for additional logic
- **Page event whitelisting** for specific pages
- **Visitor segmentation** based on other criteria

## Best Practices

### Domain Organization
- **Use descriptive domain names** - Make it clear which domain serves which purpose
- **Keep domains organized** - Document which domains are whitelisted
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify whitelisting works as expected before going live
- **Monitor performance** - Track how each domain performs

### Traffic Management
- **Route traffic appropriately** - Send real visitors to whitelisted domains
- **Use non-whitelisted domains** for compliance review
- **Consider SEO impact** - Ensure proper domain strategy for search engines
- **Plan for scale** - Consider how domain strategy will work as you grow

### Security Considerations
- **Protect whitelisted domains** - Don't share whitelisted domain URLs publicly
- **Monitor access** - Keep track of who has access to whitelisted domains
- **Regular audits** - Review domain settings periodically
- **Backup strategy** - Have fallback domains if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Whitelisting not working** - Check that the toggle is enabled and saved
- **Wrong content showing** - Verify domain spelling and configuration
- **Mixed content** - Ensure all pages on the domain have proper containers
- **Session issues** - Test in incognito mode to verify fresh session behavior

### Testing Your Setup
1. **Visit the domain directly** - Should show full content immediately
2. **Check different pages** - Verify whitelisting applies site-wide
3. **Test in incognito** - Ensure it works for new visitors
4. **Verify containers** - Make sure Whitelisted Containers are displaying
5. **Test other domains** - Ensure non-whitelisted domains show compliant content

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check domain settings** - Verify the toggle is enabled
2. **Clear browser cache** - Remove any cached content
3. **Test with different browsers** - Ensure cross-browser compatibility
4. **Check page containers** - Verify Whitelisted/Non Whitelisted containers exist
5. **Review page events** - Ensure no conflicting whitelisting rules

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Domain Strategy
**Example setup**:
- `yoursite.com` - Non-whitelisted (for compliance)
- `yoursite-vip.com` - Whitelisted (for real traffic)
- `yoursite-affiliate.com` - Whitelisted (for affiliate traffic)

### Domain-Specific Funnels
You can create different funnels for different domains:
- **Compliant funnel** - For non-whitelisted domains
- **Full funnel** - For whitelisted domains
- **Hybrid approach** - Same funnel with different content containers

### Analytics and Tracking
- **Track domain performance** separately in analytics
- **Monitor conversion rates** for each domain
- **Compare performance** between whitelisted and non-whitelisted domains
- **Optimize based on data** from each domain

## Migration from Parameter-Based Whitelisting

### Transitioning Strategy
1. **Set up new whitelisted domain** alongside existing setup
2. **Test thoroughly** with small traffic sample
3. **Gradually redirect traffic** to new domain
4. **Monitor performance** during transition
5. **Fully migrate** once confident in new setup

### Benefits of Domain-Level Whitelisting
- **Simpler URLs** - No need for complex parameters
- **Better user experience** - Cleaner, more professional URLs
- **Easier management** - Single toggle instead of complex page events
- **Consistent behavior** - All pages on domain behave the same way

## Compliance Considerations

### Platform Policies
- **Use responsibly** - Only for legitimate compliance purposes
- **Keep compliant domains functional** - Don't make them obviously fake
- **Follow platform guidelines** - Ensure compliance with ad platform terms
- **Regular policy reviews** - Stay updated with platform policy changes

### Documentation
- **Document your strategy** - Keep records of which domains serve which purpose
- **Team training** - Ensure your team understands the domain setup
- **Change management** - Document any changes to domain configuration
- **Backup procedures** - Have contingency plans for domain issues
