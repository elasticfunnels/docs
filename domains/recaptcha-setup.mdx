## Creating reCAPTCHA Keys

### Step 1: Access Google reCAPTCHA Admin
1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create"** to register a new site

### Step 2: Configure Your reCAPTCHA Site
1. **Enter a Label**: 
   - Use a descriptive name like "Elastic Funnels Domains"
   - This helps you identify the site later

2. **Select reCAPTCHA Type**:
   - Choose **"Score based (v3)"**
   - This is the recommended type for seamless user experience

3. **Add Domains**:
   - Click **"Add a domain"** button
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `example.com`)
   - **Important**: Add both www and non-www versions separately:
     - `example.com`
     - `www.example.com`
   - Repeat for all domains you want to protect
   - **Note**: You can use one reCAPTCHA key for all domains inside Elastic Funnels

4. **Select Google Cloud Platform Project**:
   - Choose an existing project from the dropdown
   - Or create a new project if needed
   - The project will be used for reCAPTCHA analytics and management

5. **Accept Terms**:
   - Review and accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service
   - Click **"Submit"** to create your site

### Step 3: Copy Your Keys
After creating your site, you'll see two keys:

1. **Site Key** (Public Key):
   - This is the public key that will be used in your frontend
   - Copy this value

2. **Secret Key** (Private Key):
   - This is the private key used for server-side verification
   - Keep this secure and never expose it publicly
   - Copy this value

## Configuring reCAPTCHA in Elastic Funnels

### Step 1: Access Domain Settings
1. Go to **Domains** in your ElasticFunnels.io dashboard
2. Find the domain you want to configure
3. Click **"Edit"** on that domain
4. Navigate to the **"Security"** tab

### Step 2: Enter Your Keys
1. **reCAPTCHA Site Key**:
   - Paste your Site Key from Google reCAPTCHA
   - This is the public key

2. **reCAPTCHA Secret Key**:
   - Paste your Secret Key from Google reCAPTCHA
   - This is the private key used for verification

3. Click **"Save"** to apply the configuration

## Important: reCAPTCHA Usage & Cost Considerations

<Warning>
**Cost Management**: Understanding how reCAPTCHA is used and optimizing placement can help you stay within the free tier and avoid unexpected costs.
</Warning>

### Where reCAPTCHA is Used
**reCAPTCHA is only used in Collection Forms** within Elastic Funnels. This includes:
- Lead capture forms
- Contact forms
- Newsletter signups
- Other collection form types

reCAPTCHA is **not** used for other form types or page elements.

### Cost-Effective Placement

#### Recommended: Dedicated Form Pages
**Best Practice**: Place collection forms on their own dedicated pages rather than in modals or popups.

**Why this matters:**
- **Reduced API calls**: reCAPTCHA v3 makes API calls each time a form is loaded
- **Cost efficiency**: Google provides 10,000 free assessments per month, but exceeding this incurs costs
- **Better user experience**: Dedicated pages provide more space and better mobile experience
- **Lower request volume**: Forms on dedicated pages are only loaded when users navigate to them

#### Avoid: Forms in Modals
**Not Recommended**: Avoid placing collection forms (especially contact forms) in modals that appear on every page load.

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Excessive API calls**: If a contact form modal loads on every page, reCAPTCHA makes a request on every page view
- **Cost implications**: High-traffic sites can quickly exceed the free tier (10,000 assessments/month)
- **Unnecessary usage**: Users may not interact with the form, but you're still paying for assessments
- **Poor ROI**: Paying for reCAPTCHA assessments that don't result in form submissions

### Best Practice
**Use dedicated form pages** (e.g., `/contact`) instead of modal forms to avoid unnecessary reCAPTCHA API calls. This ensures reCAPTCHA assessments are only made when users actually navigate to the form page, not on every page load.

## Domain Whitelisting Best Practices

### Adding Multiple Domains
When adding domains to your reCAPTCHA site:

- **Add each domain separately**: Each domain must be explicitly listed
- **Include both www and non-www**: Add both versions:
  - `example.com`
  - `www.example.com`
- **Add all subdomains**: If you use subdomains, add them too:
  - `subdomain.example.com`
- **One key for all domains**: You can use a single reCAPTCHA key for all your Elastic Funnels domains

### Example Domain List
For a complete setup, your domain list might look like:
```
example.com
www.example.com
another-domain.com
www.another-domain.com
subdomain.example.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### reCAPTCHA Not Working
- **Verify domain is whitelisted**: Check that your domain is added in Google reCAPTCHA console
- **Check both keys**: Ensure both Site Key and Secret Key are correctly entered
- **Verify domain spelling**: Make sure the domain matches exactly (including www/non-www)
- **Check key validity**: Ensure keys haven't expired or been deleted

#### Domain Not Recognized
- **Add both www and non-www**: Google treats these as separate domains
- **Check domain format**: Use the exact domain format (no trailing slashes)
- **Wait for propagation**: Changes may take a few minutes to take effect

#### Form Submission Errors
- **Verify secret key**: Ensure the Secret Key is correctly configured
- **Check server logs**: Review error logs for reCAPTCHA verification failures
- **Test with different domains**: Verify keys work across all configured domains

### Testing Your Setup
1. **Submit a test form**: Try submitting a form on your domain
2. **Check browser console**: Look for any reCAPTCHA-related errors
3. **Verify in Google Console**: Check reCAPTCHA analytics for activity
4. **Test different domains**: Ensure all whitelisted domains work correctly

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management
- **Keep Secret Key secure**: Never expose it in client-side code
- **Rotate keys periodically**: Update keys if compromised
- **Monitor usage**: Check Google reCAPTCHA console for unusual activity
- **Document your setup**: Keep records of which domains use which keys

### Domain Security
- **Only whitelist your domains**: Don't add domains you don't control
- **Regular audits**: Review whitelisted domains periodically
- **Remove unused domains**: Clean up domains you no longer use
- **Monitor for abuse**: Watch for suspicious activity in reCAPTCHA analytics

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Multiple Keys
You can use different reCAPTCHA keys for different domains:
- **Separate keys per brand**: Use different keys for different brands
- **Testing vs Production**: Use separate keys for testing environments

### Analytics and Monitoring
- **Google reCAPTCHA Console**: Monitor requests and scores
- **Score thresholds**: Adjust verification thresholds based on your needs
- **Performance metrics**: Track reCAPTCHA impact on form submissions
- **Fraud detection**: Review suspicious activity reports

## Integration with Collection Forms

### Where reCAPTCHA is Used
reCAPTCHA is **only used in Collection Forms** within Elastic Funnels. This includes:
- **Lead capture forms**: Prevents spam submissions
- **Contact forms**: Blocks automated form filling
- **Newsletter signups**: Reduces fake email addresses
- **Custom collection forms**: Works with all collection form types

<Warning>
reCAPTCHA is **not** used for other form types or page elements. It specifically protects collection forms that gather user data.
</Warning>

### Cost-Effective Form Placement

#### Recommended: Dedicated Form Pages
**Best Practice**: Place collection forms on their own dedicated pages rather than in modals or popups.

**Why this matters:**
- **Reduced API calls**: reCAPTCHA v3 makes API calls each time a form is loaded
- **Cost efficiency**: Google provides 10,000 free assessments per month, but exceeding this incurs costs
- **Better user experience**: Dedicated pages provide more space and better mobile experience
- **Lower request volume**: Forms on dedicated pages are only loaded when users navigate to them

#### Avoid: Forms in Modals
**Not Recommended**: Avoid placing collection forms (especially contact forms) in modals that appear on every page load.

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Excessive API calls**: If a contact form modal loads on every page, reCAPTCHA makes a request on every page view
- **Cost implications**: High-traffic sites can quickly exceed the free tier (10,000 assessments/month)
- **Unnecessary usage**: Users may not interact with the form, but you're still paying for assessments
- **Poor ROI**: Paying for reCAPTCHA assessments that don't result in form submissions

#### Example Scenarios

**✅ Good Practice:**
- Contact form on a dedicated `/contact` page
- Lead capture form on a dedicated landing page
- Newsletter signup on a dedicated `/newsletter` page
- Forms that only load when users explicitly navigate to them

**❌ Not Recommended:**
- Contact form modal that appears on every page load
- Popup forms that trigger on page entry
- Forms embedded in modals that load automatically
- Multiple forms on the same page that all load simultaneously

### User Experience
- **Invisible protection**: Users won't see any reCAPTCHA challenges
- **No interruptions**: Legitimate users experience no friction
- **Automatic verification**: Happens in the background
- **Fast processing**: Minimal impact on form submission speed

## Cost Management

### Understanding reCAPTCHA Pricing
- **Free tier**: 10,000 assessments per month at no cost
- **Paid tier**: Additional assessments are charged per 1,000 requests
- **Assessment = API call**: Each time a form loads, reCAPTCHA makes an assessment

### Optimizing Costs
1. **Use dedicated form pages**: Only load forms when users navigate to them
2. **Avoid modal forms on every page**: Don't load forms that users may never interact with
3. **Monitor usage**: Check Google reCAPTCHA console regularly for usage patterns
4. **Strategic placement**: Place forms where users are most likely to engage

### Monitoring Usage
- **Google reCAPTCHA Console**: Track your monthly assessment count
- **Set up alerts**: Configure notifications when approaching free tier limits
- **Analyze patterns**: Review which forms generate the most assessments
- **Optimize placement**: Adjust form placement based on actual usage data

<Note>
reCAPTCHA v3 provides powerful spam protection without impacting user experience. Remember to add both www and non-www versions of your domains, and you can use one key for all your Elastic Funnels domains. For cost-effective usage, place collection forms on dedicated pages rather than in modals that load on every page view.
