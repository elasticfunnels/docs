## Create a Collection Form

### Step 1: Set Up the Collection
1. Go to "Pages" → "Advanced" → "Collections"
2. Click "Create Collection"
3. Enter a name, define what happens on a new entry, and decide if you want to allow public export (e.g., for suppressions)

### Step 2: Configure Fields
1. Add fields (Text Field, Email Field, etc.)
2. Set attributes like required, searchable, private, and encrypt (for suppressions)

## Add Form to Your Page

### Step 3: Embed the Form

2. In the properties tab, configure the success message or choose what to do after submission (show a modal, redirect, or display a message)
3. If opting to show a modal, create it first by adding a modal component
