description: 'Learn how to authenticate your API requests'

## Overview

The ElasticFunnels API uses **API keys** for authentication. Each API key is tied to a specific user and project (brand), inheriting all the permissions of that user for that project.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Never share them publicly or commit them to version control. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Generating an API Key

1. Navigate to your project dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy and securely store your API key

<Note>
  You can regenerate your API key at any time, but this will immediately invalidate the old key. Make sure to update any integrations using the old key.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the request header using the `EF-Access-Key` header:

```bash cURL
curl https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id}/pages/all \
  -H "EF-Access-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const headers = {
  'EF-Access-Key': 'your_api_key_here',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

const response = await fetch('https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id}/pages/all', {
  headers: headers
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'EF-Access-Key': 'your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id}/pages/all',
    headers=headers
)
```

```php PHP
<?php

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/' . $brandId . '/pages/all');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'EF-Access-Key: your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
```

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of the following responses:

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```
**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

### No Brand Access

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key or brand access denied"
}
```
**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

This error occurs when:
- Your API key is valid but doesn't have access to the specified brand/project
- You're trying to access a project you're not a member of

### Missing API Key

If you don't include the `EF-Access-Key` header, you'll be redirected to the login page (for browser requests) or receive a 404 error (for API requests).

## API Key Scope and Permissions

<Info>
  Your API key inherits all permissions from your user account for the specific project.
</Info>

API keys are:
- **User-specific**: Each key is tied to your user account
- **Project-specific**: Each key is tied to a specific project (brand)
- **Permission-aware**: Your API requests have the same permissions as your user role (Owner, Admin, Editor, etc.)

### Example Permission Scenarios

**Owner/Admin**: Full access to all endpoints including team management, billing, and settings

**Editor**: Access to content management endpoints (pages, products, funnels) but not billing or team management

**Viewer**: Read-only access to analytics and content

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Regenerate your API keys periodically for enhanced security
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="code">
    Store API keys in environment variables, never in your codebase
  </Card>
  <Card title="One Key Per Integration" icon="layer-group">
    Use separate API keys for different integrations to easily revoke access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Keep track of which integrations use which keys
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Regenerating Your API Key

If your API key is compromised or you need to revoke access:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Click **Regenerate API Key**
3. Confirm the action
4. Update all integrations with the new key

<Warning>
  Regenerating an API key immediately invalidates the old key. Any integrations using the old key will stop working until updated.
</Warning>

## Testing Your Authentication

You can test your API key with a simple GET request to retrieve your brand details:

```bash
curl https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id} \
  -H "EF-Access-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

A successful response will return your project information with a `200 OK` status.
