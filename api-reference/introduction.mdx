## Welcome to ElasticFunnels API

The ElasticFunnels API allows you to programmatically manage your projects, pages, products, conversions, and analytics. Our API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

<Note>
  All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api
```

## Authentication

The ElasticFunnels API uses API keys for authentication. You can generate and manage your API keys from your project settings under the API tab.

## Making Your First Request

Here's a simple example to get your project details:

```bash cURL
curl https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id} \
  -H "EF-Access-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id}', {
  headers: {
    'EF-Access-Key': 'your_api_key_here'
  }
});

const brand = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://app.elasticfunnels.io/api/brands/{brand_id}',
    headers={'EF-Access-Key': 'your_api_key_here'}
)

brand = response.json()
```

## Rate Limits

  Rate limiting information will be added in a future update. Currently, reasonable use is expected.
