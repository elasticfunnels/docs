## Overview

The Google Ads integration allows you to automatically sync your advertising data from Google Ads and send conversion information back to Google to optimize your campaigns. This creates a powerful feedback loop that improves your ad targeting and ROI over time.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Google Ads Account

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Advertising**
2. Find **Google Ads** and click **"New integration"** or **"Manage integrations"**
3. Click **"Connect your Google Ads Account"**
4. You'll be redirected to Google to authorize access
5. Grant the necessary permissions for ad data access

<Info>
You'll need admin access to your Google Ads account to complete the authorization. A Google Ads Developer Token must be configured at the application level (contact support if needed).
</Info>

### Step 2: Select Your Ad Account

After authorization, you'll see a list of all Google Ads accounts you have access to:

1. Review the available accounts (shown with account ID and name)
2. Select the account you want to track
3. The selected account will be saved to your integration

<Tip>
If you manage multiple businesses, you can create separate integrations for each Google Ads account to keep reporting organized.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Configure Conversion Tracking (Required for Postbacks)

To enable conversion postbacks (highly recommended):

1. **Enter your Conversion Action ID**
   - Find it in Google Ads → Tools & Settings → Conversions
   - Create a new conversion action if you don't have one
   - Copy the Conversion Action ID (numeric value)
   
2. **Enable Conversion Postbacks**
   - Check the box to enable automatic postback sending
   - This sends purchase data back to Google Ads when customers complete orders

3. Click **"Update Integration"** to save

<Warning>
Conversion postbacks require a valid Conversion Action ID. If you enable postbacks without a Conversion Action ID, the system will warn you. The postback will only fire when conversions have a valid gclid (Google Click ID) parameter.
</Warning>

## Understanding Google Click ID (gclid)

### How It Works

Google Ads uses **gclid** (Google Click ID) to track which clicks lead to conversions:

1. When someone clicks your Google Ads link, Google adds a `gclid` parameter to the URL
2. ElasticFunnels automatically captures this `gclid` in the click tracking data
3. When a conversion occurs, we send the `gclid` back to Google Ads
4. Google Ads attributes the conversion to the original click

### Why This Matters

```
Example: Conversion Attribution

User clicks Google Ad → URL includes gclid=abc123
User visits your funnel → gclid is captured
User makes purchase → Conversion postback sent with gclid=abc123
Google Ads → Attributes conversion to original click
```

<Check>
The gclid is automatically captured when users click Google Ads links. You don't need to manually configure anything - just ensure you're using Google Ads tracking links.
</Check>

## Ad Spend Syncing

### Automatic Sync Schedule

Your ad spend data syncs automatically on a regular schedule. This includes:

- Daily spend amounts
- Click counts
- Impression counts
- Campaign names
- Ad group information

<Note>
Historical data is available immediately after connecting. Future data syncs automatically without any action needed.
</Note>

### Viewing Your Ad Data

After your first sync completes, you can view your ad performance:

1. Go to **Analytics → Ad Spend Reports**
2. Select your date range
3. View spend, clicks, and ROI metrics
4. Filter by campaign, ad group, or specific ads

## Conversion Postbacks

### What Are Conversion Postbacks?

Conversion postbacks send purchase information back to Google Ads when a customer completes an order. This helps Google Ads:

- Optimize your campaigns for conversions (not just clicks)
- Improve audience targeting based on who actually buys
- Provide accurate attribution data
- Enable features like automated bidding

### What Data is Sent

When a conversion occurs, we send:

- Purchase event
- Order value and currency
- Order ID
- Google Click ID (gclid)
- Conversion Action ID

<Info>
All customer data is handled according to Google's privacy requirements. Conversion data is sent securely to Google Ads.
</Info>

### When Postbacks Are Triggered

Postbacks fire automatically when:

1. ✅ Customer clicked a Google Ad (gclid present in click data)
2. ✅ Customer completed a purchase
3. ✅ Integration has postbacks enabled
4. ✅ Conversion Action ID is configured

<Warning>
If a conversion doesn't have a gclid (e.g., user didn't come from Google Ads), no postback will be sent. This is expected behavior.
</Warning>

## Tracking Link Builder Integration

The Tracking Link Builder automatically generates the correct UTM parameters for Google Ads:

**Google Ads Template:**
```
utm_source=google
utm_medium=cpc
utm_campaign={campaignid}
utm_term={keyword}
utm_content={creative}
adid=ga_{creative}_{campaignid}
```

<Info>
Access the Tracking Link Builder from **Tools → Tracking → Tracking Link Builder** or from the Pages/Funnels list dropdown menu.
</Info>

## Campaign Management

You can view and manage your Google Ads campaigns:

- View campaign information and performance
- Monitor ad group performance
- Track campaign metrics alongside funnel data

## Managing Multiple Integrations

If you manage multiple businesses or clients, you can create multiple Google Ads integrations:

### When to Create Multiple Integrations

- Managing different client accounts (agencies)
- Separate businesses with different Google Ads accounts
- Different brands under one ElasticFunnels account
- Testing vs. production campaigns

### How It Works

Each integration is independent:
- Has its own Google Ads account
- Has its own Conversion Action ID
- Has its own postback settings
- Syncs separately

<Tip>
Name each integration clearly (e.g., "Client A - Supplements", "Client B - Software") to keep them organized.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Data Appearing After Setup">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - First sync hasn't run yet
    - No ad spend in the selected date range
    - Ad account has no active campaigns
    
    **Solution:** Wait for first sync, or contact support to trigger manual sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Expired / Connection Error">
    **Cause:** Google OAuth tokens expire after a period of time
    
    **Solution:** Click the "Re-authenticate" button on your integration to refresh your connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversions Not Showing in Google Ads">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Postbacks not enabled
    - No Conversion Action ID configured
    - Customer didn't click a Google Ad (no gclid)
    - gclid expired (Google Ads has a 90-day attribution window)
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Verify Conversion Action ID is entered correctly
    2. Check "Enable Conversion Postbacks" is checked
    3. Ensure customers are clicking Google Ads links (gclid must be present)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a Developer Token?">
    **Answer:** A Developer Token is required for Google Ads API access. It's configured at the application level by ElasticFunnels support, not per integration. If you see errors about Developer Token, contact support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Conversion Postbacks">
    Always enable postbacks to help Google Ads optimize your campaigns for actual purchases, not just clicks.
