## Common Use Cases

### Abandoned Cart Recovery (HelpGrid)
When a customer enters their email but doesn't complete the purchase, their data is sent to HelpGrid. A call center agent can then reach out to help them complete the sale.

### New Order Sales (SalesBound / Committed Coaches)
Immediately after a successful purchase, order data is sent to your sales team. This is ideal for high-ticket offers where a "welcome call" or "upsell call" is part of the flow.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create the Integration

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Choose your provider from the list.
3. Enter the **Webhook URL** or **API Keys** provided by your call center account manager.
4. Save the integration.

### Step 2: Configure Merchant Filtering

By default, integrations can be set to listen to **All Merchants** or a specific **Whitelist**.

- **All Merchants**: Every conversion or abandon across your entire brand will trigger a postback.
- **Whitelist**: Only conversions from the selected merchants will be sent. Use this if you have different call centers for different products or regions.

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Most call center integrations (like HelpGrid) include a **Test Webhook** button. Use this to send a sample payload to their system and verify that the connection is active.

<Tip>
  Always verify your Webhook URL with a test before going live to ensure your data is being captured correctly.
</Tip>

## Monitoring Data

You can see all outbound postbacks to your call centers in the **Logs** section of your dashboard. If a postback fails, the system will log the error response from the provider, allowing you to troubleshoot quickly.
