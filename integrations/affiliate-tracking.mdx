<Info>

</Info>

#### Step 3: Configure UTM Parameters

The builder includes fields for all standard UTM parameters:

- **UTM Source** - The source of your traffic (e.g., "facebook", "google", "email")
- **UTM Medium** - The marketing medium (e.g., "cpc", "email", "social")
- **UTM Campaign** - The campaign name or identifier

- **UTM Content** - Additional content identifier (often used for ad set names)

<Warning>
For proper attribution in Campaigns Management, ensure UTM parameters match your campaign structure:
- `utm_campaign` = Campaign name
- `utm_content` = Ad set name
- `utm_term` = Ad name
</Warning>

#### Step 4: Add Dynamic Tokens

Click the **"Add Token"** button next to any UTM field to insert dynamic tokens that will be replaced by the ad platform:

2. Click the **"Copy Link"** button to copy it to your clipboard

### Best Practices for Tracking Links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Platform Templates">
    Always select your ad platform to ensure UTM parameters are formatted correctly for that platform's requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Match Campaign Names Exactly">
    Ensure UTM parameter values match your campaign, ad set, and ad names exactly in Meta Ads (or other platforms) for proper attribution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Dynamic Tokens">
    Prefer dynamic tokens (like `{{campaign.name}}`) over static values when possible. This ensures tracking continues to work if you rename campaigns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Your Links">
    After creating a tracking link, test it by clicking it and verifying the UTM parameters appear correctly in your analytics.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep Links Organized">
    Use consistent naming conventions in your UTM parameters to make reporting and analysis easier.
  </Step>
