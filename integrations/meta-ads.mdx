## Overview

The Meta Ads integration allows you to automatically sync your advertising data from Facebook/Meta Ads and send conversion information back to Meta to optimize your campaigns. This creates a powerful feedback loop that improves your ad targeting and ROI over time.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Meta Ads Account

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Advertising**
2. Find **Meta Ads** and click **"New integration"** or **"Manage integrations"**
3. Click **"Connect your Meta Ads Account"**
4. You'll be redirected to Facebook to authorize access
5. Grant the necessary permissions for ad data access

<Info>
You'll need admin access to your Meta Ads account to complete the authorization.
</Info>

### Step 2: Select Your Ad Account

After authorization, you'll see a list of all ad accounts you have access to:

1. Review the available accounts (shown with account ID, name, and currency)
2. Click **Select** next to the ad account you want to track
3. The selected account will be highlighted with a blue checkmark

<Tip>
If you manage multiple businesses, you can create separate integrations for each ad account to keep reporting organized.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Configure Conversion Tracking (Optional)

To enable conversion postbacks (highly recommended):

1. **Enter your Meta Pixel ID**
   - Find it in Meta Business Manager → Events Manager → Data Sources
   - It's a 15-16 digit number
   
2. **Enable Conversion Postbacks**
   - Check the box to enable automatic postback sending
   - This sends purchase data back to Meta when customers complete orders

3. Click **"Update Integration"** to save

<Warning>
Conversion postbacks require a valid Pixel ID. If you enable postbacks without a Pixel ID, the system will warn you.
</Warning>

## Understanding Pixel Attribution

### How It Works

ElasticFunnels uses a **page-based pixel tracking system** to ensure accurate attribution:

1. **Each page** in your funnel can have its own Meta Pixel ID
2. When a visitor lands on a page, we **track which pixels they were exposed to**
3. When they make a purchase, we **send conversion data to the correct pixel(s)**

### Why This Matters

```
Example: Multi-Business Scenario

Page 1 (Product A): Uses Pixel 111
Page 2 (Product B): Uses Pixel 222

If customer visits both pages and purchases:
→ Both Pixel 111 and Pixel 222 receive the conversion
→ Accurate attribution for partnership/referral funnels
```

### Setting Pixel ID per Page

You can configure the Meta Pixel ID at two levels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration Level (Recommended for Single Business)">
    Set one Pixel ID in the integration settings. This pixel will receive conversions from any page the customer visited during their journey.
    
    **Best for:** Single business with one website
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Page Level (Advanced Multi-Business)">
    Set different Pixel IDs on individual pages in your funnel settings. This allows different businesses or partners to track their own conversions.
    
    **Best for:** Agency managing multiple clients, partnership funnels
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ad Spend Syncing

### Automatic Sync Schedule

Your ad spend data syncs automatically **every 2 hours**. This includes:

- Daily spend amounts
- Click counts
- Impression counts
- Campaign names
- Ad set information

<Note>
Historical data is available immediately after connecting. Future data syncs automatically without any action needed.
</Note>

### Viewing Your Ad Data

After your first sync completes, you can view your ad performance:

1. Go to **Analytics → Ad Spend Reports**
2. Select your date range
3. View spend, clicks, and ROI metrics
4. Filter by campaign, ad set, or specific ads

## Conversion Postbacks

### What Are Conversion Postbacks?

Conversion postbacks send purchase information back to Meta when a customer completes an order. This helps Meta:

- Optimize your campaigns for conversions (not just clicks)
- Improve audience targeting based on who actually buys
- Provide accurate attribution data
- Enable features like automated bidding

### What Data is Sent

When a conversion occurs, we send:

- Purchase event
- Order value and currency
- Order ID
- Customer information (hashed for privacy)
- Click identifier (fbclid)

<Info>
All customer data is hashed and encrypted according to Meta's privacy requirements. We never send raw personal information.
</Info>

### When Postbacks Are Triggered

Postbacks fire automatically when:

1. ✅ Customer clicked a Meta ad (fbclid present)
2. ✅ Customer visited a page with a Meta Pixel
3. ✅ Customer completed a purchase
4. ✅ Integration has postbacks enabled
5. ✅ Pixel ID matches the page they visited

<Check>
The system intelligently determines which pixel to fire based on which pages the customer visited. If they saw multiple pixels, all relevant pixels receive the conversion.
</Check>

## Managing Multiple Integrations

If you manage multiple businesses or clients, you can create multiple Meta Ads integrations:

### When to Create Multiple Integrations

- Managing different client accounts (agencies)
- Separate businesses with different websites
- Different brands under one ElasticFunnels account
- Testing vs. production campaigns

### How It Works

Each integration is independent:
- Has its own ad account
- Has its own Pixel ID
- Has its own postback settings
- Syncs separately

<Tip>
Name each integration clearly (e.g., "Client A - Supplements", "Client B - Software") to keep them organized.
</Tip>

## Connection Status & Health

### Status Indicators

Your integration status shows real-time health:

- **🟢 Active** - Integration is working, data syncing normally
- **🔵 Syncing...** - Currently pulling new data from Meta
- **🔴 Error** - Connection issue that needs attention
- **⚪ Not Configured** - Integration not fully set up

### Last Sync Information

The integration card shows:
- **Last synced:** How long ago data was last updated
- **Records synced:** Number of records imported
- **Total spend:** Recent spending tracked

### Testing Your Connection

Use the **"Test Connection"** button to verify:
- Your access token is valid
- You have permission to access the ad account
- Data can be retrieved successfully

<Warning>
If you see an error status, check if your Meta session has expired. Click the re-authenticate button to refresh your connection.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Data Appearing After Setup">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - First sync hasn't run yet (syncs every 2 hours)
    - No ad spend in the selected date range
    - Ad account has no active campaigns
    
    **Solution:** Wait 2 hours for first sync, or contact support to trigger manual sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Expired / Connection Error">
    **Cause:** Meta access tokens expire after 60 days
    
    **Solution:** Click the blue "Re-authenticate" button on your integration to refresh your connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversions Not Showing in Meta">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Postbacks not enabled
    - No Pixel ID configured
    - Customer didn't visit a page with your pixel
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Verify Pixel ID is entered correctly
    2. Check "Enable Conversion Postbacks" is checked
    3. Ensure your funnel pages have pixel configured
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Ad Accounts - Which to Choose?">
    **Question:** I have 5 ad accounts listed, which should I select?
    
    **Answer:** Select the ad account that contains the campaigns you want to track. You can create multiple integrations if you need to track multiple ad accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pixel ID vs Ad Account - What's the Difference?">
    **Pixel ID:** Tracking code on your website (one per business/website)
    
    **Ad Account:** Where you manage your ad campaigns in Meta
    
    **Relationship:** Multiple ad accounts can share one pixel if they're promoting the same website.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the **Status** indicator on your integration
2. Click **"Test Connection"** to diagnose issues
3. Review the error message if one is shown

## Best Practices

### Optimization Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Conversion Postbacks">
    Always enable postbacks to help Meta optimize your campaigns for actual purchases, not just clicks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name your integrations clearly, especially if managing multiple accounts (e.g., "Main Campaign - US", "Testing Account").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Sync Status">
    Check your integration status regularly to ensure data is syncing properly and connections haven't expired.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test After Setup">
    Use the "Test Connection" button after setup to verify everything is working before running campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pixel Configuration Strategy

**Single Business:**
- Use ONE Pixel ID in your integration
- Apply to all funnel pages
- Simplest setup for most users

**Multi-Business or Agency:**
- Create SEPARATE integrations for each client
- Each integration gets its own Pixel ID
- Keeps reporting and postbacks isolated

**Partnership Funnels:**
- Set different Pixel IDs on different pages
- Partner pages fire partner's pixel
- Main pages fire your pixel
- Both get conversion credit
