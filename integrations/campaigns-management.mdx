## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using Campaigns Management, you need:

1. **A Meta Ads Integration** - Connect your Meta Ads account first
   - Go to **Settings → Integrations → Advertising**
   - Set up your Meta Ads integration (see [Meta Ads Integration](/integrations/meta-ads) guide)
   - Ensure you've selected an ad account

2. **Tracking Links Created with Tracking Link Builder** - **Required** for funnel analytics
   - You **must** use the [Tracking Link Builder](/integrations/affiliate-tracking#tracking-link-builder) to create tracking URLs
   - Select **Meta Ads** as the platform in the builder
   - The builder automatically generates the correct UTM parameters:
     - `utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}` (maps to campaign name)
     - `utm_content={{adset.name}}` (maps to ad set name)
     - `utm_term={{ad.name}}` (maps to ad name)
     - `adid=fb_{{ad.id}}` (required for ad spend tracking)

<Warning>
**Critical:** Without using the Tracking Link Builder to create your URLs with the predefined Meta Ads parameters, you'll only see Meta's ad metrics (spend, clicks, impressions). Funnel metrics (revenue, sales, profit) will not appear because the system requires the specific parameter format generated by the Tracking Link Builder.
</Warning>

<Info>
The Tracking Link Builder can be accessed from:
- **Tools → Tracking → Tracking Link Builder**
- **Pages list** → Dropdown → "Get Tracking Link"
- **Funnels list** → Dropdown → "Get Tracking Link"

See the [Setting Up UTM Tracking](#setting-up-utm-tracking) section below for detailed instructions.
</Info>

### Accessing Campaigns Management

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click on your **Meta Ads integration**
3. Look for the **"Campaigns"** tab or link
4. You'll see your campaigns list

<Info>
If you have multiple Meta Ads integrations, make sure you're viewing the one connected to the ad account you want to manage.
</Info>

## Understanding the Interface

### Campaign Hierarchy

Campaigns Management uses a three-level hierarchy:

```
Campaigns (Top Level)

</CardGroup>

<Info>
Funnel analytics require proper UTM parameters in your tracking URLs. See the "Setting Up UTM Tracking" section below.
</Info>

## Setting Up UTM Tracking

For funnel analytics to work correctly, your Meta Ads tracking URLs **must** use the specific UTM parameters predefined in the Tracking Link Builder. These parameters are required for proper attribution and to display funnel metrics in Campaigns Management.

<Warning>
**You must use the Tracking Link Builder** to generate tracking URLs with the correct parameter format. Manually creating URLs may result in missing or incorrect parameters, which will prevent funnel analytics from appearing.
</Warning>

### Required UTM Parameters (Predefined Format)

The Tracking Link Builder automatically generates URLs with these specific parameters for Meta Ads:

```
utm_source={{site_source_name}}
utm_medium={{placement}}
utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}
utm_content={{adset.name}}
utm_term={{ad.name}}
adid=fb_{{ad.id}}
```

<Info>
The `{{...}}` tokens are dynamic placeholders that Meta Ads automatically replaces with actual values when someone clicks your ad. This ensures accurate tracking even if you rename campaigns later.
</Info>

### Using the Tracking Link Builder

**Recommended Method: Use the Tracking Link Builder**

The Tracking Link Builder is the **only supported way** to create tracking URLs for Campaigns Management. It ensures:

- ✅ Correct UTM parameter format
- ✅ Proper `adid` parameter for ad spend tracking
- ✅ Dynamic tokens that auto-update with campaign names
- ✅ Compatibility with all Meta Ads features

**How to Access:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="From Tools Menu">
    1. Navigate to **Tools** in the main menu
    2. Click on the **Tracking** tab
    3. Select **Tracking Link Builder**
    4. Select **Meta Ads** from the "Auto Cost Update" dropdown
    5. Choose your destination (URL, Page, or Funnel)
    6. Copy the generated link
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="From Pages List">
    1. Go to **Pages** in the main menu
    2. Find the page you want to create a tracking link for
    3. Click the dropdown menu (three dots) on the page row
    4. Select **"Get Tracking Link"**
    5. The builder opens with your page pre-selected
    6. Select **Meta Ads** from the "Auto Cost Update" dropdown
    7. Copy the generated link
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="From Funnels List">
    1. Go to **Funnels** in the main menu
    2. Find the funnel you want to create a tracking link for
    3. Click the dropdown menu (three dots) on the funnel row
    4. Select **"Get Tracking Link"**
    5. The builder opens with your funnel pre-selected
    6. Select **Meta Ads** from the "Auto Cost Update" dropdown
    7. Copy the generated link
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Generated URL Format

When you use the Tracking Link Builder with Meta Ads selected, it generates a URL like this:

```
https://yourfunnel.com/landing-page?
  utm_source={{site_source_name}}&
  utm_medium={{placement}}&
  utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&
  utm_content={{adset.name}}&
  utm_term={{ad.name}}&
  adid=fb_{{ad.id}}
```

<Info>
For detailed instructions on using the Tracking Link Builder, including all available tokens and platform-specific templates, see the [Tracking Link Builder documentation](/integrations/affiliate-tracking#tracking-link-builder).
</Info>

### Critical Requirements

<Warning>
**Parameter Matching:** The UTM parameter values must **exactly match** your campaign, ad set, and ad names in Meta Ads for proper attribution. The Tracking Link Builder uses dynamic tokens (`{{campaign.name}}`, etc.) that automatically match, but if you manually edit the URL, ensure exact matching.

**Required Parameters:** All of these parameters must be present:
- `utm_campaign` (maps to campaign name)
- `utm_content` (maps to ad set name)
- `utm_term` (maps to ad name)
- `adid` (required for ad spend tracking)
</Warning>

### What Happens Without Proper Parameters

If your tracking URLs don't use the predefined format from the Tracking Link Builder:

- ❌ Funnel metrics (revenue, sales, profit) will show as zero
- ❌ Ad spend tracking may not work correctly
- ❌ ROI calculations will be inaccurate
- ❌ Campaign-level attribution will fail

<Info>
If you're not seeing funnel metrics in Campaigns Management, verify that:
1. You used the Tracking Link Builder to create your URLs
2. You selected "Meta Ads" as the platform
3. The URLs are correctly added to your Meta Ads campaigns
4. You have conversions in the selected date range
</Info>

## Using Date Ranges

Date ranges control which metrics are displayed:

### Without Date Range
- Shows only basic information (name, status, budget)
- No performance metrics
- No funnel analytics

### With Date Range
- Shows all Meta ad metrics (spend, clicks, impressions, etc.)
- Shows all funnel analytics (revenue, sales, profit, etc.)
- Metrics are calculated for the selected time period

### How to Select a Date Range

1. Use the **date range picker** in the top-right of the campaigns interface
2. Select your start and end dates
3. Metrics will automatically update
4. The date range is saved in the URL, so you can bookmark specific date ranges

<Tip>
Use date ranges to compare performance across different time periods. Try comparing this month vs. last month to see trends.
</Tip>

## Managing Campaigns

### Pausing and Activating

You can pause or activate campaigns, ad sets, and ads directly from the interface:

1. Find the item you want to pause/activate
2. Click the **"Pause"** or **"Activate"** button in the Actions column
3. Confirm the action in the modal
4. The status will update immediately

<Warning>
- Pausing a **campaign** pauses all its ad sets and ads
- Pausing an **ad set** pauses all its ads
- If a parent is paused, child items will show the parent's status
</Warning>

### Updating Budgets

You can update daily or lifetime budgets for campaigns and ad sets:

1. Click the **"Budget"** button in the Actions column
2. Enter either:
   - **Daily Budget**: Maximum spend per day
   - **Lifetime Budget**: Total spend for the campaign/ad set
3. Click **"Update"**
4. Changes take effect immediately in Meta Ads

<Info>
Budget amounts are in your ad account's currency. Budgets are stored in cents internally but displayed in dollars.
</Info>

### Previewing Ad Creatives

For ads, you can preview the creative assets:

1. Click an **ad name** or the **eye icon** next to it
2. A modal will open showing:
   - **Image previews** (if available)
   - **Video previews** (if available)
   - **Creative details** (ID, name, landing page URL)
   - **Download links** for video sources (MP4)

<Note>
Video previews may take a moment to load as we fetch the direct video source from Meta's API.
</Note>

## Filtering and Searching

### Status Filter

Filter campaigns, ad sets, or ads by status:

- **All** - Show all items regardless of status
- **Active** - Only show active items
- **Paused** - Only show paused items
- **Archived** - Only show archived items

### Search

Use the search box to find specific items by:

- Campaign/Ad Set/Ad name
- ID
- Objective (for campaigns)

The search is case-insensitive and searches across multiple fields simultaneously.

## Refreshing Data

### Manual Refresh

Click the **refresh button** (circular arrow icon) to manually sync data from Meta Ads.

<Warning>
To prevent rate limiting, refreshes are throttled to once every 30 seconds. If you try to refresh too soon, you'll see a warning message.
</Warning>

### Automatic Sync

Campaign data is automatically synced every 2 hours. However, for real-time status changes and budget updates, use the manual refresh button.

## Understanding Status Display

The status column shows the effective status, which may be affected by parent items:

### Campaign Level
- Shows the campaign's actual status

### Ad Set Level
- If campaign is paused: Shows "Campaign paused"
- If ad set is active but campaign is paused: Shows "Active but campaign paused"
- Otherwise: Shows the ad set's status

### Ad Level
- If ad set is paused: Shows "Ad Set paused"
- If campaign is paused: Shows "Campaign paused"
- If ad is active but parent is paused: Shows "Active but [parent] paused"
- Otherwise: Shows the ad's status

<Info>
This status display helps you understand why an ad might not be running even if it's set to "Active" in Meta Ads.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up UTM Tracking First">
    Before analyzing funnel metrics, ensure your tracking URLs include the correct UTM parameters. Use the Tracking Link Builder for accuracy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Date Ranges for Analysis">
    Always select a date range when analyzing performance. Without a date range, you'll only see basic information without metrics.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Profit, Not Just Revenue">
    Use the "Funnel Profit" column to see true ROI. A campaign with high revenue but negative profit needs optimization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare RPC vs CPC">
    If RPC (Revenue Per Click) is higher than CPC (Cost Per Click), your campaign is profitable. Use this to identify winning campaigns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Parent Status">
    If an ad set or ad shows unexpected status, check if the parent campaign is paused. The status display will indicate this.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refresh After Changes">
    After making changes in Meta Ads Manager, use the refresh button to see updates in ElasticFunnels immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Metrics Showing">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - No date range selected (metrics require a date range)
    - No ad spend in the selected date range
    - Date range is in the future
    
    **Solution:** Select a date range that includes dates with actual ad activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Funnel Metrics Show Zero">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Not using Tracking Link Builder to create URLs (most common)
    - Missing UTM parameters in tracking URLs
    - UTM parameter values don't match campaign/ad set/ad names exactly
    - No conversions in the selected date range
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. **Use the Tracking Link Builder** - This is required. Go to Tools → Tracking → Tracking Link Builder, select Meta Ads platform, and generate your URLs

## Integration with Other Features

### Analytics Dashboard

Campaign data from Campaigns Management feeds into your main Analytics dashboard:

- Ad spend metrics appear in **Analytics → Ad Spend Reports**
- Conversion data is used for ROI calculations
- Profit metrics help identify winning campaigns

### Tracking Link Builder

**Required for Campaigns Management:** The Tracking Link Builder is the only supported way to create tracking URLs that work with Campaigns Management.

**How to Use:**

1. Access the builder:
   - **Tools → Tracking → Tracking Link Builder**, OR
   - **Pages list** → Dropdown → "Get Tracking Link", OR
   - **Funnels list** → Dropdown → "Get Tracking Link"
2. Select your destination (URL, Page, or Funnel)
3. **Select "Meta Ads" from the "Auto Cost Update" dropdown** (critical step)
4. The builder automatically generates URLs with the correct UTM structure:
   - `utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}`
   - `utm_content={{adset.name}}`
   - `utm_term={{ad.name}}`
   - `adid=fb_{{ad.id}}`
5. Copy the generated link and use it in your Meta Ads campaigns

<Info>
For complete documentation on the Tracking Link Builder, including all available tokens and platform templates, see the [Tracking Link Builder guide](/integrations/affiliate-tracking#tracking-link-builder).
</Info>

### Conversion Tracking

Campaigns Management works alongside your Meta Ads integration's conversion postbacks:

- Postbacks send conversion data to Meta
- Campaigns Management shows that same data in your funnel metrics
- Both use the same UTM parameters for attribution

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often is campaign data updated?">
    Campaign data syncs automatically every 2 hours. You can also manually refresh using the refresh button (throttled to once per 30 seconds).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't I see funnel metrics?">
    Funnel metrics require:
    1. A date range selected
    2. Proper UTM parameters in your tracking URLs
    3. UTM values that exactly match your campaign/ad set/ad names
    4. Actual conversions in the selected date range
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage campaigns for multiple ad accounts?">
    Yes! Create separate Meta Ads integrations for each ad account. Each integration has its own Campaigns Management view.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Meta metrics and Funnel metrics?">
    **Meta metrics** come from Meta's API (spend, clicks, impressions) and show advertising performance.
    
    **Funnel metrics** come from your ElasticFunnels tracking (revenue, sales, profit) and show conversion performance.
    
    Together, they give you complete ROI visibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export campaign data?">
    Currently, export functionality is not available in Campaigns Management. Use the Analytics dashboard for export capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my ad show 'Active but campaign paused'?">
