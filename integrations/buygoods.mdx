### Step 1: Configure as Merchant

1. Go to **Settings → Merchants**

### Step 2: Get Postback URLs

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Affiliate Networks**
2. Find **Buygoods** and click **"Activate"** or **"Manage"**

4. These URLs will be used in your Buygoods backoffice

### Step 3: Configure in Buygoods Backoffice

1. Log into your Buygoods affiliate account
2. Navigate to the **postback/tracking section**
3. Add the **conversion URL** for successful purchases
4. Add the **refund URL** for processing refunds

</Info>

## Transaction Types

The integration supports multiple transaction types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purchase">
    When a customer completes a purchase, Buygoods automatically sends a postback. This creates a purchase conversion in ElasticFunnels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund">
    When a refund is processed, Buygoods automatically sends a postback. This creates a refund conversion linked to the original purchase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cancel">
    When an order is cancelled, Buygoods automatically sends a postback. This creates a cancel conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chargeback">
    When a chargeback occurs, Buygoods automatically sends a postback. This creates a chargeback conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commission Void">
    When a commission is voided, Buygoods automatically sends a postback. This is processed separately from order conversions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Commission notifications are processed separately from order conversions. Only actual order postbacks create conversion records.
</Info>

## Click ID Tracking

### How Click IDs Work

Buygoods uses click tracking to identify which affiliate links led to conversions:

- **Automatic Tracking:** Click information is automatically captured from Buygoods postbacks
- **Validation:** System validates click tracking data and handles any formatting issues
- **Attribution:** Conversions are automatically attributed to the affiliate link that generated the click

### Malformed Click ID Handling

If a click ID contains placeholder characters or is malformed:

- The system automatically detects invalid click IDs
- Conversion is still processed and tracked
- Issues are logged for review

<Info>
The system automatically handles malformed click IDs to ensure conversions are still tracked even if the click ID format is incorrect.
</Info>

## Conversion Updates

If you need to update an existing conversion (for example, to correct order amounts or customer information), you can configure Buygoods to send an update postback. The system will automatically update the existing conversion instead of creating a new one.

<Info>
Contact support if you need to update existing conversions. The system handles this automatically when configured properly.
</Info>

## Payment Gateway & Fulfillment Provider

### Payment Gateway Configuration

Buygoods can be configured as a payment gateway:

1. Go to **Settings → Merchants**
2. Edit your merchant
3. Select **Buygoods** as the payment gateway
4. Configure payment settings

### Fulfillment Provider Configuration

Buygoods can also be configured as a fulfillment provider:

1. Go to **Products** in the main menu
2. Edit a product
3. Select **Buygoods** as the fulfillment provider
4. Configure fulfillment settings

<Tip>
You can use Buygoods as both a payment gateway and fulfillment provider, or use it for just one function depending on your needs.
</Tip>

## Automatic Tracking Pixel Creation

When you configure Buygoods as a merchant:

- Tracking pixels are automatically created
- Pixels track page views and conversions
- Enables accurate attribution for Buygoods orders
- Works with the pixel attribution system

<Info>
Tracking pixels are created automatically when the merchant is configured. You don't need to manually set them up.
</Info>

- **Cancellation Tracking**: Track cancelled orders

- **Order Information:** Order ID, order amount, and transaction details
- **Customer Information:** Customer name and email address
- **Transaction Type:** Purchase, refund, cancellation, chargeback, or commission void
- **Click Tracking:** Information about which affiliate link generated the conversion

</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Postback URLs">
    Double-check that postback URLs are copied correctly into Buygoods backoffice. Any typos will prevent postbacks from working.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with Small Purchase">
    Test the integration with a small purchase first to verify tracking works before running large campaigns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Click IDs">
    Check your conversion data regularly. While the system handles malformed click IDs automatically, it's better to ensure Buygoods links are formatted correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Tracking Pixels">
    Tracking pixels are created automatically when you configure Buygoods as a merchant. Verify they're working by checking your conversion attribution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle All Transaction Types">
    Ensure your Buygoods configuration handles all transaction types (purchases, refunds, cancellations, chargebacks) appropriately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security & Privacy

- Postback URLs are unique to your account
- Click IDs are validated before processing
- Customer data is handled securely
- All transactions are logged for audit purposes

<Info>
Allow up to 15 minutes for data to appear after a purchase. Postbacks are processed in real-time, but there may be a slight delay.
</Info>
