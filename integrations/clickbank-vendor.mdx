This guide covers setting up ClickBank as a vendor to sell your products through the ClickBank marketplace, including pitch flow configuration and merchant setup.

<Note>This is for vendors selling through ClickBank. If you're an affiliate promoting ClickBank products, see the [ClickBank Affiliate Integration](/integrations/clickbank) instead.</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Active ClickBank vendor account
- Approved products in ClickBank marketplace
- Admin access to your ClickBank account
- Understanding of ClickBank pitch flow system

## Step 1: Create ClickBank Merchant

### Add Merchant Configuration
1. Go to **Merchants** → **Add Merchant**
2. Select **Gateway**: ClickBank
3. Enter your **Account ID** (your ClickBank account nickname)
4. Create an **Encryption Key** (see below for details)
5. Save the merchant configuration

### Understanding Encryption Keys
The encryption key is **not** an API key - it's a security key you create:

- **Purpose**: Encrypts data sent between ClickBank and Elastic Funnels
- **Security**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks on postback data
- **User-defined**: You create this key (can be any string)
- **Synchronization**: Must be identical in both ClickBank and Elastic Funnels

**Example**: `MySecretKey2024!` (use your own unique key)

### Postback URL Configuration
Once saved, the merchant will provide:
- **Postback URL**: Copy this for ClickBank configuration
- **Verification**: Use ClickBank's verify button to test the connection

## Step 2: Configure Domain-Merchant Assignment

### Assign Merchant to Domain
1. Go to **Domains** → **Edit Domain**
2. Select your ClickBank merchant from the dropdown
3. Save the domain configuration

This ensures all funnels on this domain use ClickBank for payments.

## Step 3: Set Up ClickBank Pitch Flow

### Create Pitch Flow in ClickBank
1. Log into your ClickBank account
2. Go to **Pitch Flows** section
3. Click **Create New Pitch Flow**
4. Add all product variants you plan to split test:
   - Different price points (3 bottles, 6 bottles, 12 bottles)
   - Different bonus packages
   - Different upsell combinations
5. Save and note the **Pitch Flow ID** (CBFID)

### Best Practices for Pitch Flow Setup
- **Include all variants**: Add every product combination you might test
- **Avoid re-approval delays**: Having all variants pre-approved saves time
- **Organize logically**: Group related products together
- **Document variants**: Keep track of which IDs correspond to which products

## Step 4: Configure Funnel Integration

### Set Funnel Pitch Flow ID
1. Go to **Funnels** → **Edit Funnel**
2. In the funnel settings, you'll see:
   - **ClickBank Pitch Flow ID**: Enter your CBFID
   - **ClickBank Template Code**: Enter if using custom templates
3. Save the funnel configuration

### Default Funnel Setup
- **Make funnel default**: Check this option if you want this funnel to handle all traffic to the domain without the `f=` parameter
- **URL access**: Visitors can access via `domain.com` or `domain.com?f=funnel_id`

## Step 5: Configure Postback in ClickBank

### Add Postback URLs
1. In your ClickBank account, go to **Account Settings**
2. Navigate to **Postback** section
3. Add the postback URL from your merchant configuration
4. Configure for:
   - **Sale notifications**: Instant notification of purchases
   - **Refund notifications**: Automatic refund processing
   - **Conversion tracking**: Attribution and analytics

### Test Postback Connection
1. Use ClickBank's **Verify** button
2. This tests the connection between ClickBank and Elastic Funnels
3. Should show successful verification with your encryption key

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Product Testing
When split testing different products:
1. **Add all products** to the same pitch flow in ClickBank
2. **Use page events** to show different purchase buttons
3. **Pass product IDs** in the purchase links
4. **Track performance** of each variant

### Custom Purchase Links
Purchase links automatically use the funnel's CBFID:
- **Standard format**: `[BUY=product_code]`
- **With parameters**: `[BUY=product_code extra=campaign_data]`
- **No manual CBFID**: System automatically adds the funnel's pitch flow ID

### Upsell Configuration
1. **Create upsell nodes** in your funnel
2. **Connect to purchase nodes** for the main product
3. **Use funnel-level split testing** or page events for upsell variants
4. **Configure decline flows** for users who don't purchase upsells

## Split Testing Strategies

### Funnel-Level Split Testing
Test different upsell sequences:
1. **Connect split test node** between purchase and upsell
2. **Create different upsell paths** for each variant
3. **Track performance** of each upsell sequence

### Page-Level Split Testing
Test different product presentations:
1. **Use page events** to show different content
2. **Connect to query parameter conditions** for traffic segmentation
3. **Show different purchase buttons** based on test variant

### Product Variant Testing
Test different price points:
1. **Include all variants** in ClickBank pitch flow
2. **Use dynamic content** to show different prices
3. **Track conversion rates** for each price point

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Postback not working:**
- Verify encryption key matches in both systems
- Check postback URL is correctly entered in ClickBank
- Ensure merchant is properly assigned to domain

**Purchase links not working:**
- Verify funnel has correct CBFID
- Check that merchant is assigned to the domain
- Ensure products exist in ClickBank pitch flow

**Split testing not working:**
- Verify all product variants are in the pitch flow
- Check that page events are properly connected
- Ensure domain-merchant assignment is correct

### Testing Your Setup
1. **Use ClickBank's test mode** for initial testing
2. **Verify postback reception** in Elastic Funnels
3. **Test purchase flow** end-to-end
4. **Check conversion tracking** in both systems

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep encryption keys secure** - don't share them
- **Use strong, unique keys** - avoid simple passwords
- **Regularly rotate keys** - update periodically for security
- **Monitor postback logs** - watch for unusual activity
- **Test with small amounts** - verify everything works before full launch

## Support and Documentation

- **ClickBank documentation**: Refer to ClickBank's vendor guides
- **Encryption key help**: Contact support if postback verification fails
- **Funnel configuration**: Use the built-in help system for node setup
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor both ClickBank and Elastic Funnels analytics

<Warning>
Ensure all your ClickBank pitch flow products are compliant with ClickBank's marketplace policies. Non-compliant products can result in account suspension.
