## Overview

The fulfillment integration allows you to automatically send conversion data to your fulfillment providers. Once an order is placed, ElasticFunnels syncs the details with your 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) provider to handle shipping and tracking.

## Supported Providers

## How It Works

1. **Order Received** → A customer completes a purchase on your funnel.
2. **Merchant Mapping** → The system identifies the merchant associated with the sale.
3. **Integration Trigger** → If a fulfillment integration is assigned to that merchant, a job is queued.
4. **Data Sync** → Order details (customer info, shipping address, products) are sent to the provider.
5. **Tracking Update** → Once shipped, the provider sends back a tracking number which is synced to your dashboard.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Connect your Provider

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Select your fulfillment provider (e.g., **ShipOffers** or **Jetpack**).
3. Enter your API credentials (API Key, Secret, etc.) provided by your 3PL.
4. Save the integration.

### Step 2: Assign to Merchants

Unlike pixel integrations which can run globally, fulfillment is tied directly to your **Merchants**.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Merchants**.
2. Edit the merchant that should use this fulfillment provider.
3. Select the integration in the **Fulfillment Integration** dropdown.
4. Save the merchant settings.

### Step 3: Map Product SKUs

To ensure the correct items are shipped, you must ensure your product SKUs in ElasticFunnels match the SKUs in your fulfillment provider's system.

1. Go to **Products**.
2. Ensure each product has a valid **SKU** that matches your 3PL's catalog.

## Automation & Sync

Orders are typically processed in real-time or via a scheduled queue (usually every hour) depending on your system configuration. You can monitor the status of every fulfillment attempt in the **Conversions → Fulfillment** section.

<Info>
  If a fulfillment attempt fails (e.g., due to an invalid address), you can manually retry or edit the order details from the Fulfillment list.
