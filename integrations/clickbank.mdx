## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Secret Key

<Warning>
**Important:** Clickbank uses a **Secret Key** (not an API key) for postback validation. This is different from other integrations.
</Warning>

1. Log into your ClickBank account
2. Go to **Settings → My Account**
3. Navigate to the **Secret Key** section (not API Keys)
4. Generate or copy your Secret Key
5. Keep this key secure - you'll need it for validation

<Info>
The Secret Key is used to validate that postbacks are actually coming from Clickbank. It's encrypted and stored securely in ElasticFunnels.
</Info>

### Step 2: Configure Integration

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Affiliate Networks**
2. Find **Clickbank (S2S)** and click **"Activate"** or **"Manage"**
3. Enter your **Secret Key**
4. Copy the **Postback URL** provided
5. Save the integration

<Note>This integration is used as an affiliate. To set up ClickBank as a merchant, see [ClickBank](/merchants/clickbank).</Note>

### Step 3: Configure in Clickbank

1. Log into your ClickBank account
2. Go to **Settings → My Site → Advanced Tools**
3. Navigate to **Postback URLs** or **S2S Postback**
4. Add the postback URL from ElasticFunnels
5. Save your settings

<Check>
The postback URL is unique to your ElasticFunnels account. Clickbank will send postbacks to this URL when orders are placed.
</Check>

## Secret Key Encryption

### How It Works

The Secret Key is used to validate postbacks:

1. **Encrypted Storage:** Secret key is encrypted before being stored
2. **Postback Validation:** Each postback is validated using the secret key
3. **Security:** Only postbacks with valid secret keys are processed
4. **Privacy:** Secret key is never exposed in logs or responses

### Security Best Practices

- **Never Share:** Keep your secret key secure and never share it
- **Regular Rotation:** Consider rotating your secret key periodically
- **Monitor Usage:** Watch for any unusual postback activity
- **Encrypted Storage:** Secret key is automatically encrypted in ElasticFunnels

<Warning>
If you suspect your secret key has been compromised, generate a new one in Clickbank and update it in ElasticFunnels immediately.
</Warning>

## Click ID Tracking

### How Click Tracking Works

Clickbank uses click tracking to identify which affiliate links led to conversions:

- **Automatic Tracking:** Click tracking information is automatically captured from Clickbank postbacks
- **Attribution:** Conversions are automatically attributed to the affiliate link that generated the click
- **Validation:** System validates click tracking data before processing conversions

<Info>
Click tracking information is automatically handled by the system. You don't need to configure anything manually.
</Info>

## Transaction Types

The integration supports multiple transaction types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purchase">
    When a customer completes a purchase, Clickbank automatically sends a postback. This creates a purchase conversion in ElasticFunnels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund">
    When a refund is processed, Clickbank automatically sends a postback. This creates a refund conversion linked to the original purchase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chargeback">
    When a chargeback occurs, Clickbank automatically sends a postback. This creates a chargeback conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upsell">
    When an upsell is purchased, Clickbank automatically sends a postback. Upsells are tracked separately from initial purchases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Order Tracking

### How Orders Are Tracked

Clickbank uses receipt tracking to link transactions:

- **Purchase Receipts:** Each purchase gets a unique receipt identifier
- **Refund/Chargeback Linking:** Refunds and chargebacks are automatically linked back to the original purchase

### How It Works

When a refund or chargeback occurs, the system automatically links it to the original purchase using receipt tracking. This ensures accurate commission tracking and order history.

<Info>
Receipt tracking is handled automatically by the system. Refunds and chargebacks are always linked to their original purchases.
</Info>

## Automation Integration

### Triggering Automations

You can trigger automation workflows when Clickbank postbacks are received:

1. Go to **Automations** in the main menu
2. Create or edit an automation
3. Add a trigger node
4. Select **"On Clickbank Postback"** from the trigger options
5. Configure your automation actions

### Use Cases

- **Welcome Emails:** Send welcome emails when purchases are received
- **Follow-up Sequences:** Start email sequences based on Clickbank events
- **CRM Updates:** Update CRM records when conversions occur
- **Custom Workflows:** Build custom automation workflows for Clickbank events

<Info>
Automation triggers fire automatically when Clickbank postbacks are received and processed successfully.
</Info>

## Tracking Pixels

When you configure Clickbank as a merchant:

- Tracking pixels are automatically created
- Pixels track page views and conversions
- Enables accurate attribution for Clickbank orders
- Works with the pixel attribution system

<Info>
Tracking pixels are created automatically when the merchant is configured. You don't need to manually set them up.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<Steps>

  <Step title="Test with Small Purchase">
    Test the integration with a small purchase first to verify tracking works before running large campaigns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Receipt IDs">
    Monitor receipt IDs to ensure refunds and chargebacks are properly linked to original purchases.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Automation Triggers">
    Use automation triggers to build custom workflows based on Clickbank events (welcome emails, CRM updates, etc.).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle Upsell Transactions">
    Upsell transactions are automatically tracked separately from initial purchases. Monitor your conversion data to see both initial purchases and upsells.
  </Step>
</Steps>
