## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Find Your Measurement ID

Your Measurement ID can be found in your Google Analytics account:

1. Go to **Admin → Property Settings** in Google Analytics
2. Look for **"Measurement ID"** (starts with `G-` for GA4)
3. Copy the entire ID including the `G-` prefix

<Info>
The Measurement ID format is `G-XXXXXXXXXX` where X is alphanumeric. Make sure to copy the entire ID including the `G-` prefix.
</Info>

### Step 2: Configure Measurement ID

You can configure Google Analytics at two levels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Page-Level Configuration (Recommended)">
    Set a Measurement ID for each individual page in your funnel.
    
    **How to:**
    1. Go to **Pages** in the main menu
    2. Edit the page you want to track
    3. Find the **Google Analytics** section in page settings
    4. Enter your Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
    5. Save the page
    
    **Best for:** Different funnels, brands, or campaigns that need separate GA4 properties
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Global Script Configuration (Alternative)">
    Configure a global tracking script that applies to all pages.
    
    **How to:**
    1. Go to **Settings → Tracking Scripts**
    2. Add a new tracking script
    3. Select **Google Analytics** as the script type
    4. Enter your Measurement ID
    5. Save the script
    
    **Best for:** Single brand with one GA4 property for all pages
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Page-level configuration gives you more flexibility. You can use different GA4 properties for different funnels, brands, or campaigns, enabling better segmentation and reporting.
</Tip>

## How It Works

### Automatic Page View Tracking

When a page loads with a configured Measurement ID:

1. The GA4 tracking script is automatically injected
2. A page view event is sent to Google Analytics
3. The Measurement ID is captured in the pixel attribution system
4. User behavior and traffic sources are tracked

<Check>
Page views are tracked automatically - you don't need to add any tracking code manually. Just configure the Measurement ID and it works.
</Check>

### Pixel Attribution Integration

Google Analytics Measurement IDs are integrated with the pixel attribution system:

- Enables multi-touch attribution across multiple pages
- Works with conversion postbacks for advertising platforms
- Supports accurate conversion attribution

<Info>
The pixel attribution system tracks which GA4 properties a visitor was exposed to, enabling accurate multi-touch conversion attribution.
</Info>

## Custom Event Tracking

### Setting Up Custom Events

You can track custom events through page interactions:

1. **In Page Builder:**
   - Add an interaction to a button, link, or element
   - Select **"Custom GA Event"** as the interaction type
   - Configure the event name and parameters

2. **Event Parameters:**
   - Event name (required)
   - Event category (optional)
   - Event label (optional)
   - Event value (optional)

### Example Custom Events

Track important user actions:

- **Form Submissions:** Track when users submit lead forms
- **Button Clicks:** Track clicks on important CTAs
- **Video Plays:** Track video engagement
- **Scroll Depth:** Track how far users scroll
- **Time on Page:** Track engagement duration

<Note>
Custom events appear in Google Analytics Real-Time reports within seconds.
</Note>

## What You'll Track

- **Page Views**: See which pages get the most traffic
- **User Behavior**: Understand how visitors navigate your funnel
- **Traffic Sources**: Identify your best-performing channels
- **Conversion Paths**: See the complete customer journey
- **Demographic Data**: Learn about your audience demographics
- **Custom Events**: Track specific user interactions
- **Multi-Touch Attribution**: See which pages contributed to conversions

## Integration with Conversion Postbacks

Google Analytics integrates with the conversion postback system:

- GA4 Measurement IDs are captured when visitors view pages
- When conversions occur, the system knows which GA4 properties were viewed
- This enables accurate attribution for advertising platforms
- Supports multi-touch attribution across the customer journey

<Info>
The integration works seamlessly with Meta Ads, Google Ads, and other advertising platforms for comprehensive conversion tracking.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Page Views Not Showing in GA4">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Measurement ID not configured on the page
    - Incorrect Measurement ID format (must include G- prefix)
    - GA4 property not receiving data
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Verify Measurement ID is entered correctly (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
    2. Check page settings to ensure Measurement ID is saved
    3. Test in GA4 Real-Time reports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Events Not Tracking">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Event not configured correctly in page builder
    - Event name contains invalid characters
    - GA4 property not receiving events
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify event is configured in page interactions
    2. Check event name format (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens only)
    3. Test in GA4 Real-Time reports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Different Pages Need Different GA4 Properties">
    **Answer:** Yes! Configure Measurement IDs at the page level. Each page can have its own GA4 Measurement ID, allowing you to use different GA4 properties for different funnels or brands.
