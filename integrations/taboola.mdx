description: 'Send conversion postbacks to Taboola for native advertising campaign optimization'
---

## Overview

The Taboola integration enables S2S (server-to-server) conversion tracking to Taboola's native advertising platform. When conversions occur in ElasticFunnels, postbacks are automatically sent to Taboola with conversion data, enabling accurate campaign attribution and optimization.

## How It Works

### The Flow

1. **User clicks Taboola ad** → Taboola generates click ID
2. **Taboola redirects to your page** → Appends click ID to URL (e.g., `?click_id=ABC123`)
3. **ElasticFunnels captures click ID** → Stored in click tracking data
4. **Customer makes purchase** → Via any payment gateway
5. **Postback automatically sent** → Conversion data sent to Taboola with click ID for attribution

### What Makes This Unique

Taboola postbacks help optimize your native advertising campaigns by sending conversion data back to Taboola, similar to how conversion pixels work for Facebook or Google Ads.

<Info>
This integration is perfect for native advertising campaigns where you want Taboola's algorithm to optimize based on actual conversions, not just clicks.
</Info>

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Account ID

1. Log into your Taboola account
2. Navigate to **Account Settings**
3. Find your **Account ID** (format: `networkname-advertiser`)
4. Copy this ID - you'll need it in the next step

<Info>
The Account ID identifies your Taboola advertiser account. It's typically in the format `networkname-advertiser`.
</Info>

### Step 2: Configure Event in Taboola Realize

Before setting up the integration, configure your conversion event in Taboola:

1. Go to **Taboola Realize** (Taboola's tracking platform)
2. Navigate to **Conversion Settings**
3. Create or note your **Event Name** (e.g., `purchase`)
4. This must match **exactly** (case-sensitive)

<Warning>
The Event Name must match exactly what you configure in ElasticFunnels, or conversions won't be tracked. It's case-sensitive!
</Warning>

### Step 3: Create Taboola Integration

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Advertising**
2. Find **Taboola** and click **"Activate"**
3. Enter your **Account ID**
4. Enter your **Event Name** (must match Taboola Realize)
5. The postback URL will be automatically generated

### Step 4: Configure Click ID Parameter

Select which parameter Taboola uses to pass the click ID to your pages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="click_id or click-id (Most Common)">
    Taboola passes the click ID as `click_id` or `click-id` in the URL.
    
    **Example:** `yoursite.com/page?click_id=ABC123`
    
    **Use when:** Your Taboola campaign uses standard tracking parameters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="taboola_click_id (Alternative)">
    Some Taboola campaigns use a prefixed parameter name.
    
    **Example:** `yoursite.com/page?taboola_click_id=ABC123`
    
    **Use when:** Your Taboola tracking links use this parameter name.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
**How to check:** Look at a sample Taboola tracking link. The parameter that contains the long unique ID is your click ID parameter.
</Info>

### Step 5: Customize Parameters (Optional)

Use the parameter builder to customize what data is sent to Taboola:

1. **Default parameters** are pre-configured (click-id, name, revenue, currency, orderid)
2. **Add custom parameters** by clicking "+ Add Parameter"
3. **Select variables** from the dropdown for each parameter
4. **Remove optional parameters** by clicking the X button

**Available Variables:**

- **Required:** click_id, event_name
- **Conversion:** order_id, revenue, currency, quantity
- **Customer:** email, phone

<Warning>
**click-id and name are required** and cannot be removed. Taboola needs these to attribute conversions correctly.
</Warning>

### Step 6: Configure Merchant Filtering (Optional)

Choose which merchants should send postbacks to Taboola:

**All Merchants (Default):**
- Postbacks sent for conversions from any payment gateway

**Specific Merchants:**
- Click "Specific merchants" radio button
- Select which merchants to track
- Only selected merchants will send postbacks

### Step 7: Save and Test

1. Click **"Save Integration"**
2. Test by clicking a Taboola ad and making a purchase
3. Verify conversion appears in Taboola dashboard

## Configuration Options

### Postback URL

The postback URL is automatically generated from your Account ID and parameters:

**Format:**
```
https://trc.taboola.com/actions-handler/log/{ACCOUNT_ID}/s2s-action?click-id={click_id}&name={event_name}&revenue={revenue}&currency={currency}&orderid={order_id}
```

**When a conversion happens, macros are replaced:**
```
https://trc.taboola.com/actions-handler/log/mynetwork-advertiser/s2s-action?click-id=ABC123&name=purchase&revenue=99.99&currency=USD&orderid=ORD456
```

### Account ID

Your Taboola advertiser account identifier. Typically in format `networkname-advertiser`.

### Event Name

The event name **must match** what's configured in Taboola Realize. Common values:
- `purchase` - For completed purchases
- `lead` - For lead submissions
- `signup` - For registrations
- Custom names as configured in your Taboola account

<Warning>
Event Name is **case-sensitive**. `purchase` ≠ `Purchase` ≠ `PURCHASE`
</Warning>

### Click ID Parameter

Tells ElasticFunnels which URL parameter contains Taboola's click ID. Options:
- `click_id` (common)
- `click-id` (Taboola standard)
- `taboola_click_id` (alternative)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Conversions Showing in Taboola">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Click ID not found in click data
    - Event Name doesn't match Taboola Realize
    - Integration not enabled
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify customer clicked a Taboola ad before purchasing
    2. Check Event Name matches Taboola Realize exactly (case-sensitive)
    3. Verify integration is enabled
    4. Check ElasticFunnels logs for postback attempts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Name Not Matching">
    **Issue:** Taboola reports "Event not found" or similar error
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Log into Taboola Realize
    2. Check the exact Event Name (case-sensitive)
    3. Update ElasticFunnels integration to match exactly
    4. Event Name must be configured in Taboola first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Click ID Not Found">
    **Issue:** Postbacks not sending because click ID isn't detected
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check which parameter Taboola uses in tracking URLs
    2. Update "Click ID Parameter" dropdown to match
    3. Common options: click_id, click-id, taboola_click_id
    4. System automatically checks fallbacks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="204 No Content Response">
    **Explanation:** This is normal! Taboola returns HTTP 204 (No Content) for successful postbacks.
    
    **What it means:** Your postback was received and processed successfully by Taboola.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Event in Taboola First">
    Always set up your conversion event in Taboola Realize before configuring ElasticFunnels.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Match Event Name Exactly">
    Event Name is case-sensitive. `purchase` ≠ `Purchase`. Double-check spelling and capitalization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with Small Campaign">
    Test the integration with a small Taboola campaign first to verify tracking works.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Taboola Dashboard">
    Check your Taboola dashboard to confirm conversions are being received.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Standard Parameter Names">
    Stick to Taboola's standard parameter names (click-id, revenue, orderid) for compatibility.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Details

### Postback Method

Postbacks are sent via **HTTP GET requests**, which is the standard for Taboola S2S integration.

### Response Codes

- **204 No Content** - Success (standard Taboola response)
- **200 OK** - Also considered success
- **4xx/5xx** - Error (logged for debugging)

### Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:
- Failed postbacks are logged but don't break conversion creation
- Network timeouts handled gracefully
- Invalid URLs caught and logged
- System continues working even if Taboola is temporarily unavailable

### Queue Processing

Postbacks are processed asynchronously via the `conversions` queue:
- Doesn't slow down conversion creation
- Automatic retry on temporary failures
- Can be monitored via queue logs

## Compatibility

### Works With Any Payment Gateway

The Taboola integration works regardless of which payment gateway you use. Taboola tracks attribution (which ad generated the conversion), independent of how payment is processed.

### Works With Multiple Campaigns

Compatible with running multiple Taboola campaigns:
- Different Account IDs per campaign
- Different Event Names per conversion type
- Merchant-specific tracking per campaign

## Integration Architecture

<Note>
**Important:** Taboola is an **outbound integration** - we send conversion data TO Taboola, we don't receive data FROM Taboola. This is the same pattern as Google Ads and Meta Ads conversion tracking.
</Note>

### What This Means

- **No incoming postbacks** - Taboola doesn't send data to us
- **Triggered by conversions** - Postbacks fire when purchases occur
- **Attribution only** - Used to tell Taboola which ads generated conversions
- **Works with any merchant** - Compatible with any payment processor

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which click ID parameter should I use?">
    **Answer:** Look at a sample Taboola tracking link. The parameter containing the unique ID is your click ID parameter.
    
    - Most campaigns use `click_id` or `click-id`
    - Some use `taboola_click_id`
    - The system automatically checks fallbacks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Event Name and Conversion Name?">
    **Answer:** 
    - **Event Name** - Technical identifier used in postbacks (e.g., `purchase`)
    - **Conversion Name** - Display name in Taboola dashboard (e.g., "Product Purchase")
    
    Use the Event Name from Taboola Realize, not the Conversion Name.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track multiple conversion types?">
    **Answer:** Yes! Create separate integrations for each conversion type:
    
    - Integration 1: Event Name = `purchase` (completed purchases)
    - Integration 2: Event Name = `lead` (lead submissions)
    - Integration 3: Event Name = `signup` (registrations)
    
    Each integration can have different merchant filtering and settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Taboola return 204 No Content?">
    **Answer:** This is normal and expected. HTTP 204 means "success with no response body." It's Taboola's standard way of acknowledging receipt of your postback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until conversions appear in Taboola?">
    **Answer:** Postbacks are sent immediately when conversions are created (within seconds). Taboola should show the conversion in real-time or within a few minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I test before going live?">
    **Answer:** Yes!
    1. Set up the integration
    2. Click a Taboola test ad
    3. Make a small test purchase
    4. Check Taboola dashboard to verify conversion was received
    5. Review ElasticFunnels Logs → External Postbacks to confirm sending
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## URL Parameter Format

### Standard Taboola Format

Taboola requires the `click-id` parameter to use a **hyphen** (not underscore):

```
✅ Correct: ?click-id=ABC123
❌ Wrong:   ?click_id=ABC123  (underscore)
```

<Warning>
The parameter name must be exactly `click-id` in the URL sent to Taboola, or conversions won't be recorded.
</Warning>

### How We Handle This

Our integration automatically:
- Uses `click-id` (with hyphen) in the postback URL to Taboola
- But can detect `click_id`, `click-id`, or `taboola_click_id` from incoming URLs
- You don't need to worry about the hyphen/underscore difference

## Multiple Integrations

You can create multiple Taboola integrations for different use cases:

### When to Create Multiple Integrations

- **Different campaigns** - Separate account IDs
- **Different conversion types** - Different event names (purchase, lead, signup)
- **Different merchants** - Track specific payment gateways
- **Client separation** - Agencies managing multiple clients

### How It Works

Each integration is independent:
- Has its own Account ID
- Has its own Event Name  
- Has its own merchant filtering
- Sends separately to Taboola

<Tip>
Name each integration clearly (e.g., "Taboola - Purchase Events", "Taboola - Lead Events") to keep them organized.
</Tip>

## Logging & Monitoring

### View Postback Logs

1. Navigate to **Logs → External Postbacks**
2. Filter to see Taboola postbacks
3. View success/failure status
4. See request/response details
5. Debug any issues

### What Gets Logged

- Postback URL sent
- All parameters and values
- Response code (204 = success)
- Response body
- Timing information

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling

- **Click ID** - Unique identifier from Taboola (not sensitive)
- **Customer Data** - Only sent if configured (email, phone are optional)
- **HTTPS Only** - All postbacks use secure connections
- **URL Encoding** - All data properly encoded

### Privacy Considerations

You can exclude customer information:
- Disable email parameter if needed
- Disable phone parameter
- Still track conversions with just revenue and order ID
