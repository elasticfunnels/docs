## Overview

The Shopify Order Sync integration automatically creates orders in Shopify when customers purchase through ElasticFunnels. This keeps Shopify as your central hub for tax reporting, accounting, and 3PL fulfillment while allowing you to use ElasticFunnels for your checkout experience.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Shopify Store

1. Navigate to **Integrations**, open the **Operations** tab, and find **Shopify**
2. Click **"New integration"** (or open your existing Shopify integration)
3. Enter your Shopify store domain (e.g., `yourstore.myshopify.com`)
4. Click **"Connect to Shopify"**
5. You'll be redirected to Shopify to authorize access
6. Grant the necessary permissions for order management

<Info>
You'll need admin access to your Shopify store to complete the authorization.
</Info>

### Step 2: Authorize the App

After clicking connect, Shopify will ask you to grant permissions:

- **Read orders** - View existing orders
- **Write orders** - Create new orders
- **Read customers** - View customer information
- **Write customers** - Create customer records

Click **"Install app"** to authorize ElasticFunnels.

### Step 3: Configure Your Merchant

To enable order syncing for specific merchants:

1. Go to **Merchants** in ElasticFunnels
2. Edit the merchant you want to sync orders from
3. Open the **Order Sync** tab
4. Select your Shopify integration from the dropdown
5. Click **"Save"**

<Tip>
You can configure multiple merchants to sync to the same Shopify store, or create different integrations for different stores if you manage multiple businesses.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Test the Integration

Make a test purchase through your funnel:

1. Complete a test transaction
2. Wait 15 seconds
3. Check your Shopify admin → Orders
4. Look for orders tagged with **"ElasticFunnel"**

<Check>
Test orders should appear in Shopify with full details including customer info, line items, and payment status marked as "paid".
</Check>

## How Order Sync Works

Every completed order from ElasticFunnels is synced with its full line items (product names, quantities, and prices from your ElasticFunnels products). You do not need to create products in your Shopify catalog first — each order is sent with custom line items from ElasticFunnels.

### Sync Timeline

```
Purchase Completed in ElasticFunnels
         ↓ (10 seconds)
Fulfillment Scheduled (if configured)
         ↓ (15 seconds)
Order Sync to Shopify
         ↓
Order Appears in Shopify Admin
```

### What Gets Synced

When an order syncs to Shopify, we include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Information">
    - Email address
    - First and last name
    - Phone number
    - Billing address
    - Shipping address
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Order Details">
    - Line items (products purchased)
    - Quantities and prices
    - Order number from ElasticFunnels
    - Purchase timestamp
    - Payment method used
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Financial Information">
    - Subtotal amount
    - Tax calculations from ElasticFunnels
    - Shipping costs
    - Discount codes applied
    - Total order value
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metadata & Tags">
    - Order tagged as "ElasticFunnel"
    - EF order ID and number in order notes
    - Funnel ID reference
    - Source identified as "ElasticFunnel"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fulfillment Status (if available)">
    - Fulfillment provider name
    - Tracking number
    - Carrier information
    - Shipment status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Information Gets Synced

When an order syncs to Shopify, all essential details are included:

- **Customer name and email** - Full contact information
- **Billing and shipping addresses** - Complete address details
- **Products purchased** - Item names, quantities, and prices
- **Order totals** - Subtotal, tax, shipping, and final total
- **Payment information** - Payment method and status (marked as "paid")
- **Order number** - Your ElasticFunnels order reference
- **Tracking details** - Shipping tracking if fulfillment was processed

<Warning>
Orders are created with **custom line items** and are not linked to your Shopify product catalog. This means you don't need to create products in Shopify first - everything is sent from ElasticFunnels.
</Warning>

## Financial Status

All orders synced from ElasticFunnels are marked with:

- **Financial Status:** `paid` - Payment already collected in ElasticFunnels
- **Payment Gateway:** Shows the payment method used (e.g., "Stripe", "PayPal")
- **Transaction Type:** Marked as `sale` with `success` status

<Info>
Since payment is collected in ElasticFunnels before syncing, all orders appear as "paid" in Shopify. This is correct and expected behavior.
</Info>

## Fulfillment Integration

If your merchant has fulfillment configured:

### Fulfillment Data Included

When orders have fulfillment information from your 3PL provider:

- Fulfillment status
- Provider name (e.g., "ShipOffers", "Jetpack")
- Tracking number
- Carrier information

This information is added to the **order notes** in Shopify for your 3PL to reference.

### Order Notes Example

```
Order Source: ElasticFunnel
EF Order ID: ord_12345
EF Order Number: ABC123XYZ
Funnel ID: 42

=== Fulfillment Information ===
Status: shipped
Provider: ShipOffers
Tracking: 1Z999AA10123456784
Carrier: UPS
```

## Managing Multiple Stores

If you manage multiple Shopify stores:

### Create Multiple Integrations

1. Go to **Integrations** → **Operations**
2. Click **"New integration"** for **Shopify** for each store
3. Connect each store separately
4. Name them clearly (e.g., "Shopify - US Store", "Shopify - EU Store")

### Assign to Merchants

Each merchant can sync to a different Shopify store:

- **Merchant A** → Shopify US Store
- **Merchant B** → Shopify EU Store
- **Merchant C** → No syncing

<Tip>
This is useful if you run multiple brands or international stores. Each ElasticFunnels merchant can sync to the appropriate Shopify store.
</Tip>

## Reconnecting Your Store

If your integration shows an error or needs reconnection:

1. Open your Shopify integration in **Integrations** → **Operations**
2. Click **"Reconnect"** button
3. You'll be redirected through the authorization flow again
4. A new access token will be obtained
5. Order syncing will resume automatically

<Note>
Shopify OAuth tokens don't expire unless you uninstall the app or regenerate your API credentials. Reconnection is rarely needed.
</Note>

## Sync Status & Monitoring

### Order Sync Statuses

Each order has a sync status:

- **Pending** - Scheduled, waiting to be sent
- **Synced** - Successfully sent to Shopify
- **Failed** - Error occurred (will retry automatically)

### Automatic Retries

If an order fails to sync, the system automatically tries again:

- First few retries happen within minutes
- Later retries happen after longer intervals
- System retries up to 5 times over several hours

After all retries fail, you'll see a "Failed" status and may need to reconnect your integration.

<Warning>
If multiple orders show as failed, check your integration status. You may need to reconnect to Shopify.
</Warning>

## Finding Synced Orders in Shopify

To locate orders that came from ElasticFunnels:

### Method 1: Tag Filter

1. Go to Shopify Admin → **Orders**
2. Click **"Filters"**
3. Add filter: **Tagged with** = `ElasticFunnel`
4. View all EF orders

### Method 2: Source Filter

Orders show **"ElasticFunnel"** as the source in the order details.

### Method 3: Order Notes

Check order notes for:
- EF Order ID
- EF Order Number
- Funnel ID
- Fulfillment information

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orders Not Syncing">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Integration not assigned to merchant
    - Shopify access token invalid
    - Network connectivity issue
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify integration is selected in merchant's Order Sync tab
    2. Check integration status shows "Active"
    3. Try reconnecting the integration
    4. Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection Failed During Setup">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Incorrect store domain entered
    - Authorization cancelled
    - Session expired
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify your store domain is correct (e.g., yourstore.myshopify.com)
    2. Try connecting again
    3. Clear browser cookies if session issues persist
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Orders Syncing with Wrong Prices">
    **Expected Behavior:** Prices in Shopify match what customers paid in ElasticFunnels, not your Shopify catalog prices.
    
    **This is correct!** The integration is designed to allow different pricing in ElasticFunnels vs Shopify. The synced price is the actual amount the customer was charged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Shows as Disabled">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - App uninstalled from Shopify
    - Access token revoked
    - API credentials changed
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check if app is still installed in Shopify Admin → Apps
    2. Click "Reconnect" in ElasticFunnels to re-authorize
    3. Verify Shopify app is active in your store
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Customer Information">
    **Cause:** Not all customer fields are required
    
    **Solution:** This is normal if customers didn't provide optional information. Essential fields (email, name) will always be present.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection & Authentication

Once you connect your Shopify store, the integration remains active indefinitely:

- No need to reconnect regularly
- Connection stays active until you uninstall the app
- Secure authorization through Shopify's standard process

### If You Need to Reconnect

You may need to reconnect if:

1. You see a "Disconnected" status in your integration
2. Orders stop syncing unexpectedly
3. You reinstall the app in Shopify

Simply click the **"Reconnect"** button and authorize again.

## Data Privacy & Compliance

### What Data We Access

When you connect Shopify, we request permission to:

- Read and write orders
- Read and write customer information
- Read product catalog (for future features)
- Read inventory levels (for future features)

### How We Store Your Data

- OAuth tokens encrypted in database
- Order sync records stored for status tracking
- No sensitive customer data retained long-term
- Customer PII only used during sync operation

### GDPR Compliance

Our Shopify app implements all mandatory compliance webhooks:

- **customers/data_request** - Responds to customer data export requests
- **customers/redact** - Handles customer data deletion requests
- **shop/redact** - Deletes shop data 48 hours after uninstall

<Info>
ElasticFunnels doesn't store customer PII separately. Customer data is only synced to Shopify and not retained in ElasticFunnels after the order is created.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test First">
    Make a test purchase to verify orders sync correctly before going live with real customers.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tag for Organization">
    All orders are automatically tagged "ElasticFunnel" in Shopify for easy filtering and reporting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Sync Status">
    Check your integration status regularly to ensure orders are syncing without issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Per Merchant">
    Set up order sync for each merchant individually. Not all merchants may need Shopify syncing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep Integration Connected">
    Don't uninstall the Shopify app. If you need to disconnect, do so through ElasticFunnels settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Line Items vs Product Linking

Orders are created with **custom line items** that don't link to your Shopify product catalog:

**Advantages:**
- No product setup required in Shopify
- Prices can differ between platforms
- Product names/descriptions come from ElasticFunnels
- Faster setup and configuration

**Considerations:**
- Reports based on Shopify product variants won't include EF orders
- Inventory tracking doesn't affect EF orders
- Product changes in Shopify don't affect synced orders

<Info>
This approach is intentional. It allows maximum flexibility with pricing and doesn't require maintaining a product catalog in both systems.
</Info>

### Syncing Tax Calculations

Tax amounts calculated in ElasticFunnels are sent to Shopify exactly as charged:

- Tax rate preserved
- Tax amount matches what customer paid
- Proper tax reporting for accountants
- No recalculation in Shopify

<Check>
This ensures your tax records in Shopify match what customers actually paid, which is critical for accounting and tax compliance.
</Check>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this create products in Shopify?">
    No. Orders are created with custom line items that don't link to Shopify products. This means you don't need to maintain a product catalog in both systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sync different prices in EF vs Shopify?">
    Yes! That's the main benefit. The price sent to Shopify is the actual price charged in ElasticFunnels, which can be different from your Shopify catalog prices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if Shopify is down?">
    Orders will retry automatically up to 5 times with exponential backoff. Most temporary issues resolve themselves without intervention.
  </Accordion>

- You can reinstall and reconnect anytime
- No data is lost

### Privacy & Data Handling

- Customer information only used during order creation
- Data sent to Shopify matches what customers provided at checkout
- No customer data stored long-term in ElasticFunnels
- Orders exist in Shopify for your records

<Info>
We don't retain customer information after syncing orders. All customer data lives in Shopify where you can manage it according to your privacy policy.
</Info>

## Using Shopify as checkout

If you want to **sell through Shopify** from your funnels (instead of or in addition to syncing orders from other gateways), use one of these merchants:

- **[Shopify Checkout](/merchants/shopify-checkout)** — Redirects visitors to your Shopify cart and native checkout. Simple cart link; no upsells in the same flow.
- **[Shop Pay](/merchants/shop-pay)** — Creates a draft order in Shopify and sends the customer to checkout (Shop Pay one-click for returning customers; supports bumps).

Both require your Shopify store to be connected in **Integrations** → **Operations** (Shopify). Map each product to a **Shopify variant ID** in the product’s **Merchant information** tab. See the linked guides for step-by-step setup.
