description: "Understanding default checkout redirects and domain-funnel assignment for purchase flows"
---

When customers purchase from pages that aren't properly assigned to a funnel, the system automatically redirects them to a default thank you page instead of following your intended funnel flow. Understanding and configuring this behavior is crucial for maintaining your sales funnel continuity.

## Default Redirect Behavior

### When Default Redirects Occur

The system redirects customers to a generic thank you page (`/thank-you`) in these situations:

1. **Page Not in Expected Funnel**: The customer purchases from a VSL page, homepage, or landing page that isn't part of any active funnel
2. **No Active Funnel on Domain**: There's no funnel assigned to the current domain the customer is purchasing from
3. **Missing Funnel Parameter**: The customer accessed the page without the `?f=funnel_id` parameter and no default funnel is set

### Why This Happens

This default behavior serves as a **fallback mechanism** to ensure:
- Customers always receive purchase confirmation
- The checkout process completes successfully
- No customers are left without a post-purchase experience
- Business continuity even when funnel configuration is incomplete

<Warning>
While the default redirect ensures checkout completion, it bypasses your intended upsell sequences, tracking, and custom post-purchase flows. Proper domain-funnel assignment is essential for optimal conversion rates.
</Warning>

## Domain-Funnel Assignment

### Understanding Domain Assignment

Every funnel can be assigned to one or more domains to control which funnel handles purchases from that domain.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Domain Assignment**: Links a specific domain to a funnel
- **Default Funnel**: The funnel that handles all traffic on a domain without explicit funnel parameters
- **Funnel Parameter**: The `?f=funnel_id` URL parameter that explicitly specifies which funnel to use

### How to Assign Domains to Funnels

#### Step 1: Access Funnel Settings
1. Go to **Funnels** in your dashboard
2. Select the funnel you want to configure
3. Click **Settings** or **Edit Funnel**

#### Step 2: Configure Domain Assignment
1. In the funnel settings, find the **Domain Assignment** section
2. Click **Add Domain** 
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yoursite.com`)
4. Choose assignment type:
   - **Explicit Only**: Requires `?f=funnel_id` parameter
   - **Default for Domain**: Handles all traffic without parameters

#### Step 3: Set as Default (Optional)
1. Check **"Make Default"** if you want this funnel to handle all traffic on this domain
2. This eliminates the need for the `?f=` parameter for most visitors
3. Save your configuration

### Multiple Domain Configuration

You can assign multiple domains to the same funnel:

**Example Setup:**
- Main domain: `yoursite.com` (set as default)
- Backup domain: `backup-domain.com` (set as default)
- Testing domain: `test.yoursite.com` (explicit only)

## The Funnel Parameter System

### Understanding `?f=funnel_id`

The funnel parameter (`?f=`) explicitly tells the system which funnel to use:

**Examples:**
- `https://yoursite.com/page?f=main-funnel` - Uses "main-funnel"
- `https://yoursite.com/page?f=upsell-sequence` - Uses "upsell-sequence"
- `https://yoursite.com/page` - Uses default funnel (if set) or triggers default redirect

### When to Use Funnel Parameters

#### **Required Scenarios:**
- **Multiple funnels per domain**: When you have different products/campaigns
- **Testing new funnels**: Before making them default
- **Affiliate-specific funnels**: Different flows for different traffic sources
- **Campaign-specific flows**: Unique sequences for different marketing campaigns

#### **Optional Scenarios:**
- **Single funnel per domain**: Set as default to avoid parameter requirement
- **Simple product flows**: When you only have one purchase path
- **General traffic**: Most visitors can use the default funnel

### Best Practices for Parameter Usage

**For Traffic Sources:**
```
Facebook Ads: https://yoursite.com/page?f=facebook-funnel&source=fb
Google Ads: https://yoursite.com/page?f=google-funnel&source=google
Affiliate Links: https://yoursite.com/page?f=affiliate-funnel&aff=partner123
```

**For Product Lines:**
```
Product A: https://yoursite.com/page?f=product-a-funnel
Product B: https://yoursite.com/page?f=product-b-funnel
Premium: https://yoursite.com/page?f=premium-funnel
```

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Single Product Website
**Scenario**: One main product with one sales funnel

**Setup:**
1. Create one funnel: "main-sales-funnel"
2. Assign your domain: `yoursite.com`
3. **Set as default**: âœ… Checked
4. **Result**: All purchases automatically use the correct funnel

### Example 2: Multi-Product Website
**Scenario**: Multiple products with different upsell sequences

**Setup:**
1. Create multiple funnels:
   - "weight-loss-funnel" 
   - "muscle-gain-funnel"
   - "supplements-funnel"
2. Assign all to domain: `fitnesssite.com`
3. **Set default**: Choose your main product funnel
4. **Use parameters** for other products:
   - Weight loss: `?f=weight-loss-funnel`
   - Muscle gain: `?f=muscle-gain-funnel`
   - Supplements: `?f=supplements-funnel`

### Example 3: Multiple Domains
**Scenario**: Different brands on different domains

**Setup:**
1. **Brand A Funnel**: 
   - Domain: `brand-a.com` (default)
   - Handles all Brand A traffic
2. **Brand B Funnel**:
   - Domain: `brand-b.com` (default)  
   - Handles all Brand B traffic
3. **Testing Funnel**:
   - Domain: `test.brand-a.com` (explicit only)
   - Requires `?f=test-funnel` parameter

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Customers Going to Default Thank You Page

**Symptoms:**
- Customers complete purchase but see generic thank you page
- Missing expected upsells or post-purchase flow
- No funnel tracking data for purchases

**Solutions:**
1. **Check domain assignment**: Ensure your domain is assigned to a funnel
2. **Verify default setting**: Make sure a default funnel is set if not using parameters
3. **Test with parameters**: Try accessing with `?f=your-funnel-id`
4. **Review purchase links**: Ensure buy buttons are on funnel-assigned pages

### Issue: Wrong Funnel Executing

**Symptoms:**
- Customers enter wrong upsell sequence
- Incorrect post-purchase flow
- Wrong tracking attribution

**Solutions:**
1. **Check parameter conflicts**: Multiple funnel parameters can cause conflicts
2. **Review default funnel**: Default might be overriding intended funnel
3. **Verify URL structure**: Ensure funnel parameters are correctly formatted
4. **Test explicit parameters**: Use specific `?f=` parameters to override defaults

### Issue: Funnel Parameter Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Funnel parameter ignored
- Always defaults to same funnel
- Parameter appears in URL but doesn't change behavior

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify funnel ID**: Check that the funnel ID in parameter matches exactly
2. **Check funnel status**: Ensure the target funnel is active and published
3. **Review domain configuration**: Confirm funnel is assigned to the current domain
4. **Clear cache**: Browser or CDN caching might serve old configuration

## Testing Your Configuration

### Step 1: Test Default Behavior
1. Visit your page without any parameters: `https://yoursite.com/page`
2. Complete a test purchase
3. Verify you enter the correct funnel flow

### Step 2: Test Explicit Parameters
1. Visit with funnel parameter: `https://yoursite.com/page?f=your-funnel-id`
2. Complete a test purchase
3. Confirm the specified funnel executes

### Step 3: Test Edge Cases
1. **Invalid funnel ID**: `?f=nonexistent-funnel` (should fall back to default)
2. **Empty parameter**: `?f=` (should use default funnel)
3. **Multiple parameters**: `?f=funnel1&f=funnel2` (should use first valid one)

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Domain is assigned to intended funnel
- [ ] Default funnel is set (if desired)
- [ ] Test purchases complete successfully
- [ ] Correct upsell sequences execute
- [ ] Analytics track properly
- [ ] All purchase links work correctly

## Best Practices

### Domain Management
1. **Set clear defaults**: Every active domain should have a default funnel
2. **Document assignments**: Keep track of which domains use which funnels
3. **Regular testing**: Test purchase flows on all domains monthly
4. **Monitor analytics**: Watch for unexpected redirect patterns

### Funnel Parameter Strategy
1. **Use descriptive IDs**: Make funnel IDs clear and memorable
2. **Document parameter usage**: Track which campaigns use which parameters
3. **Test all combinations**: Verify every parameter/domain combination works
4. **Monitor performance**: Compare conversion rates across different funnels

### Maintenance & Updates
1. **Regular audits**: Review domain-funnel assignments quarterly
2. **Test after changes**: Always test purchase flows after configuration changes
3. **Monitor customer feedback**: Watch for complaints about unexpected experiences
4. **Update documentation**: Keep team informed of configuration changes

<Note>
Proper domain-funnel assignment is crucial for maximizing your conversion rates and providing seamless customer experiences. Take time to configure this correctly before launching any marketing campaigns.
