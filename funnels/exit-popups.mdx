An exit popup appears when a user's mouse moves toward leaving the page, giving you a final opportunity to engage them.

## Setup

### Step 1: Create the Popup
1. Go to "Pages" → "Advanced" → "Popups"
2. Click "Create Popup" and give it a name
3. Select a base template if needed

### Step 2: Configure Exit Intent
1. Return to the page events builder for the page
2. Click "Add Node" and select the "Exit Intent" node
3. Add a "Popup" node and connect it to the "Exit Intent" node

## Best Practices

- Keep your exit popup message compelling but not intrusive
- Offer genuine value (discount, bonus content, etc.)
- Test different popup designs and messages
- Don't show exit popups on every page - be strategic
- Consider mobile user experience (exit intent works differently on mobile)
