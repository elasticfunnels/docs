**Trigger pages** are the pages that can **start** a funnel. They correspond to the first page (or page group) right after the **entry** node in the funnel builder. Only visits that land on one of these pages are considered to be "in" this funnel from the start.

## Why trigger pages matter

- They define the **entry points** for the funnel (e.g. which VSL or landing page URLs count as the start of this funnel).
- They stay in sync with the funnel flow: when you change the flow in the builder (e.g. connect entry to different pages), trigger pages are updated automatically when you save the builder.
- When you edit them in the funnel form (**Trigger pages** tab), saving updates both the stored list and the flow so the builder and the form always match.

## Where to set them

When creating or editing a funnel, open the funnel form (e.g. from the Funnels list). The form has three tabs:

1. **General** — Title, status, domains.
2. **Trigger pages** — List of pages that can start this funnel.
3. **Trigger Rules** — When to use this funnel (e.g. by country, affiliate, or query). See [Trigger Rules](/funnels/trigger-rules).

In the **Trigger pages** tab you can:

- See the currently selected trigger pages as removable tags.
- Click **Add Page** to open a searchable dropdown and add one or more pages.
- Remove a page by clicking the × on its tag.
- Save the funnel — the flow (the node connected to entry in the builder) is updated to match.

If the funnel has any trigger pages (or trigger rules), the tab shows an **orange badge** with the count so you can see at a glance that they're configured.

## How they relate to the funnel builder

In the **funnel builder**, the **entry** node is the start of the flow. The node(s) connected directly from entry are either:

- A single **page** node — that page is the only trigger page.
- A **page group** node — the pages in that group are the trigger pages.

When you:

- **Save the funnel form** with changes to trigger pages — the app updates the flow so the entry connects to a page group (or single page) with exactly those pages.
- **Save the funnel builder** after changing which pages follow entry — the app updates the stored trigger pages list to match the flow.

So the **Trigger pages** tab and the **builder** always reflect the same set of entry pages once you save from either place.

## Summary

| What you do | What happens |
|-------------|---------------|
| Add/remove pages in the **Trigger pages** tab and save the funnel | Stored trigger pages and the flow (entry → page group) are updated. |
| Change the flow in the builder (e.g. connect entry to different pages) and save | Stored trigger pages are updated to match the flow. |
| Open a funnel that was created before trigger pages existed | Trigger pages are derived from the current flow; you can edit them in the tab and save to store them. |

For rule-based behavior (when to show this funnel by country, affiliate, or URL), see [Trigger Rules](/funnels/trigger-rules).
