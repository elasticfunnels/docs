Page Events allow you to create complex logic flows that control what happens when visitors interact with your pages. Think of it as a visual programming system for your funnel.

## Understanding Page Events

Page Events use a **node-based system** where you connect different actions and conditions to create custom visitor experiences.

### Node Execution Flow
Page Events follow a specific execution order:
- **Left to right** - Nodes execute in left-to-right order
- **Top to bottom** - When multiple nodes connect from one source, they execute top to bottom
- **Sequential processing** - Each node completes before moving to the next

### Entry Points
Every page event flow starts from an entry point:
- **Page Load** - Triggers when the page first loads
- **Form Submit** - Triggers when a form is submitted
- **Button Click** - Triggers when specific buttons are clicked
- **Exit Intent** - Triggers when user tries to leave the page

## Core Node Types

### Condition Nodes
Control flow based on visitor data or behavior:

**Query Parameter Condition**
- Check if URL parameters exist or have specific values
- Example: `vtID` equals `k` for whitelisting
- Supports operators: equals, not equals, contains, is empty, is not empty

**Script Rule** 
- Advanced JavaScript-based conditions
- Check visitor location, device, referrer, etc.
- Custom logic for complex scenarios

**Split Test Component**
- Randomly assign visitors to different variants
- Set traffic percentages for each variant
- Connect to different content or actions

### Action Nodes
Perform specific actions based on conditions:

**Whitelist Visitor**
- Mark visitor as whitelisted for session
- Allows access to Whitelisted containers
- Persists across page navigation

**Mark Visitor as Not Whitelisted**
- Remove whitelist status
- Force visitor to see compliant content
- Useful for testing or conditional access

**Load Page**
- Load a different page into the same URL
- Maintain URL while changing content
- Alternative to redirect for compliance

**Redirect to URL**
- Send visitor to a different URL
- External or internal redirects
- Useful for affiliate links or external tools

**Dynamic Container**
- Change content within containers
- Personalize based on visitor data
- A/B test specific elements

### Utility Nodes
Helper nodes for complex flows:

**Sequence**
- Acts like a "for each" loop in programming
- Executes connected nodes one by one
- Useful for organizing complex flows
- Ensures proper execution order

**Router**
- Creates junction points in your flow
- Generates unique URLs for testing
- Useful for complex split testing scenarios

## Advanced Page Event Patterns

### Whitelisting Flow
Common pattern for visitor-based content display:

1. **Page Load** → **Query Parameter Condition** (`vtID` is not empty)
2. **Yes** → **Whitelist Visitor**
3. **No** → Continue with compliant content

### Split Testing with Conditions
Test different content for whitelisted users:

1. **Page Load** → **Query Parameter Condition** (`vtID` is not empty)  
2. **Yes** → **Sequence** → **Whitelist Visitor** + **Split Test Component**
3. **Split Test** → Load different page variants

### Dynamic Content Personalization
Show different content based on visitor data:

1. **Page Load** → **Script Rule** (check affiliate ID)
2. **Affiliate ID = 100** → **Dynamic Container** (show special pricing)
3. **Other** → **Dynamic Container** (show regular pricing)

## Best Practices

### Flow Organization
- **Keep flows simple** - Complex flows are harder to debug
- **Use descriptive names** for nodes and connections
- **Group related logic** with Sequence nodes
- **Test each branch** of your logic

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimize node chains** - Long chains can slow page loading
- **Use efficient conditions** - Simple parameter checks are faster than complex scripts
- **Consider caching** - Some conditions can be cached for performance

### Debugging Tips
- **Test in incognito mode** - Avoid cached states
- **Use browser developer tools** - Check for JavaScript errors
- **Test all conditions** - Verify both true and false paths
- **Check parameter spelling** - Case-sensitive parameter names

## Common Use Cases

### Affiliate Management
- Show different content based on affiliate ID
- Redirect to affiliate-specific pages
- Track affiliate performance

### Geographic Targeting
- Show different offers based on visitor location
- Redirect to region-specific pages
- Comply with local regulations

### Device Optimization
- Show mobile-optimized content on mobile devices
- Redirect to app store links on mobile
- Optimize for different screen sizes

### Traffic Source Optimization
- Show different content based on referrer
- Optimize for different traffic sources
- Track campaign performance

## Integration with Other Features

### Funnel Integration
Page Events work seamlessly with funnel flows:
- **Purchase nodes** trigger after successful page events
- **Upsell flows** can use page event data
- **Conversion tracking** includes page event data

### Analytics Integration
Page Events provide rich data for analytics:
- **Node execution tracking** - See which paths visitors take
- **Conversion attribution** - Track which events lead to conversions
- **Performance metrics** - Monitor page event execution times

### Form Integration
Page Events can respond to form submissions:
- **Pre-submission validation** - Check form data before submission
- **Post-submission actions** - Redirect or show content after submission
- **Conditional form processing** - Different actions based on form data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Events not firing** - Check node connections and entry points
- **Conditions not working** - Verify parameter names and values
- **Page not loading** - Check for infinite loops in your flow
- **Content not updating** - Verify container names and dynamic content setup

### Testing Strategies
1. **Start simple** - Test basic flows before adding complexity
2. **Use browser tools** - Check console for errors
3. **Test all paths** - Verify both success and failure conditions
4. **Clear session data** - Reset visitor state between tests
5. **Use preview mode** - Test without affecting live traffic

<Note>
Page Events are powerful but require careful planning. Start with simple flows and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the system.
