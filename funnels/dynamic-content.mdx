title: 'Dynamic Content'
description: 'Create content that changes based on user behavior, location, or other conditions'
---

Dynamic content automatically updates elements for scenarios like showing special pricing to certain affiliates or location-based offers.

## Core Concepts

Before setting up, it helps to understand the relationship between containers and components:

- **1 Container = 1 Page Location**: Think of a Dynamic Container as a specific "slot" on your page (e.g., the Header slot, the Video slot, or a Banner slot).
- **Multiple Containers**: If you want to change both the Header AND the Footer, you need **two separate** Dynamic Containers.
- **Variations**: If you want 4 different versions of a specific section (e.g., 4 different banners), the setup is:
  - **1 Dynamic Container** placed on the page where the banner goes.
  - **1 Default Version** built directly inside that container (shown if no conditions are met).
  - **3 Alternative Versions** built and saved as **Custom Components** (swapped in when conditions are met).

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Custom Components
Dynamic content works by swapping **Custom Components**. You cannot dynamically swap raw elements (like Divs or Sections) unless they are converted first.

1. Build the section or element you want to display (e.g., a specific pricing table).
2. Right-click the element and select **Transform to Component**.
3. Once saved, you can remove it from the page (unless it serves as your default content).
4. Repeat this for every variation you need.

### Step 2: Add Dynamic Container
To add a container to your page:
1. Right-click the element you want to make dynamic (or the area where you want the container).
2. Select **Wrap in** > **Dynamic Container**.
3. **Default Content**: Any content directly inside this container acts as the default view.
4. **Dynamic Swapping**: The container will swap this default content with the **Custom Components** you created in Step 1 based on your rules.

### Step 3: Define Logic
You can use any logic within the **Page Events** system to trigger content swaps. This gives you flexibility to use URL parameters, Split Tests, or user behavior as triggers.

**Example Workflow:**
1. Open the **Manage Page Events** screen.
2. Start with a trigger like **On Page Loaded**.
3. Add a "Condition" node (e.g., "Product Check" or "Script Rule").
4. Connect the condition to a **Dynamic Content** action.
5. Select your target **Container** and the **Component** to show for that condition.

> **Troubleshooting:**
> - **"No dynamic components found"**: Verify that you have successfully transformed your content variations into Custom Components as described in Step 1.
> - **Components not appearing in list**: Ensure you have **saved the page** after creating your components. Click the **reload icon** next to the component dropdown to refresh the list.

## Use Cases

- **Affiliate-specific content**: Show different pricing or bonuses based on referral source
- **Location-based offers**: Display region-specific content or pricing
- **Traffic source targeting**: Customize content based on where visitors came from
- **Device-specific content**: Show different content for mobile vs desktop users
- **Time-sensitive offers**: Display content based on time of day or date ranges

## Advanced Tips

- Use multiple conditions for more precise targeting
- Test your dynamic content thoroughly across different scenarios
- Keep fallback content for when conditions aren't met
- Monitor performance of different content variations
