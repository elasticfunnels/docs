Dynamic content automatically updates elements for scenarios like showing special pricing to certain affiliates or location-based offers.

## Setup

### Step 1: Wrap Components
In the page builder, wrap the desired element (e.g., packages) in a "Dynamic Container" block. Name the block for easy reference.

### Step 2: Define Conditions
In the page events builder, click "Add Node" and select "Script Rule." Specify conditions (e.g., affiliate ID, location).

### Step 3: Set Up the Dynamic Container
Add a "Dynamic Container" node and specify the content to replace when conditions are met.

## Use Cases

- **Affiliate-specific content**: Show different pricing or bonuses based on referral source
- **Location-based offers**: Display region-specific content or pricing
- **Traffic source targeting**: Customize content based on where visitors came from
- **Device-specific content**: Show different content for mobile vs desktop users
- **Time-sensitive offers**: Display content based on time of day or date ranges

## Advanced Tips

- Use multiple conditions for more precise targeting
- Test your dynamic content thoroughly across different scenarios
- Keep fallback content for when conditions aren't met
- Monitor performance of different content variations
