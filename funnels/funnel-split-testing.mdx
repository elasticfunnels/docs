title: 'Funnel Split Testing'
description: 'Split test entire pages or branches in your funnel'

Funnel-level split testing lets you test different pages or branches of your funnel. It works like component split testing, but instead of selecting a component inside a page, you select a target page or another node in the funnel.

## Setup

### Step 1: Add a Split Test to your funnel
1. Open your funnel in the builder
2. Click "Add Node" where you want to branch traffic
3. Select "Split Test" as the node type

### Step 2: Create your variants
1. For each variant, choose a target:
   - **Page**: Send visitors to a specific page node
   - **Node**: Send visitors to any existing node (e.g., an alternate VSL path)
2. Set traffic percentages (must total 100%)
3. Name variants clearly (e.g., "VSL A", "VSL B")

### Step 3: Connect and save
1. Connect the split test node to each target page/node
2. Ensure downstream nodes (purchase, upsells, declines) are connected
3. Click "Save" and reload to confirm layout

## Best Practices

- Keep one variable per test (page vs. branch) for clean attribution
- Run tests long enough to reach statistical significance
- Use clear variant names and document the hypothesis
- Monitor performance and disable losing variants promptly

<Note>
If you only need to test content inside a single page (like headlines or videos), use **component split testing** instead: [Split Testing](/funnels/split-testing).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

- Variants not receiving traffic: verify percentages total 100% and connections are valid
- Wrong page loading: check that each variant points to the intended page/node
- Missing upsell flow: ensure variant targets connect to the correct purchase/upsell nodes
