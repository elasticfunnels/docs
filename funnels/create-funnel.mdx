Learn how to start a fresh funnel, assign domains, and organize your funnel steps.

1. From your main dashboard, click on "Funnels"
2. Click the "Create New Funnel" button
3. Enter a funnel name
4. Assign one or more domains (optional: set as default for a domain)
5. Proceed to the builder interface
6. Click "Add Node" to add your first funnel step (e.g., a page or a redirect)
7. Connect your nodes to define the journey
8. Click "Save" to store your changes

<Note>
Rearranging nodes: In the funnel builder, drag nodes to reposition them. Use the "Rearrange" control to auto-layout when the canvas gets messy. Save, then reload to confirm the layout persists.
</Note>

## Tips

- Choose a descriptive funnel name that reflects your campaign or product
- Setting a default domain helps streamline the setup process
- Start simple with just a few nodes, you can always add more complexity later
- Test your funnel flow before going live
