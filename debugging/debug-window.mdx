The Debug Window is a powerful development tool for ElasticFunnels that provides real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities for your pages. It helps developers and marketers understand how their funnels, events, and interactions are performing.

<Note>
The Debug Window loads asynchronously. Open it with **Ctrl + Shift + F12** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Shift + F12** (Mac) on any ElasticFunnels page, or click **Debugger** in the top bar on any builder or code editor page.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### Activating the Debug Window

1. **Open your ElasticFunnels page** in a web browser
2. **Press Ctrl + Shift + F12** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Shift + F12** (Mac) to activate the debug window
3. **The debug window slides up** from the bottom of the screen

The debug window automatically starts monitoring your page and capturing relevant debugging information.

## Debug Window Tabs

### Overview

The Overview tab provides a quick snapshot of your page's current state:

#### System Information
- **Device**: Current device type detection
- **Screen**: Browser window dimensions
- **Viewport**: Available content area
- **User Agent**: Browser information

#### App State
- **FID**: Funnel ID
- **Page ID**: Current page identifier
- **Brand ID**: Associated brand
- **Page Events**: Number of configured events
- **Interactions**: Number of tracked interactions
- **SIDs**: Session identifiers

### Events

Monitor your page's funnel events:

#### Funnel Visualization
- **Event hierarchy**: Visual representation of your funnel structure
- **Event details**: Step IDs, data, and next events
- **Event flow**: How events connect and trigger



### Page Events

Inspect backend-evaluated page events (populated by the server during the request):

- **Refresh**: Re-read the current page's backend events
- **Clear**: Clear the frontend cache of events for this page
- **Export**: Download a JSON file with the full backend debug payload
- **Status**: See whether debug is enabled, total events, event types, last event time, and the current debug key

Each event shows its type, relative time, status, and a details section. Expand ‚ÄúFull Context‚Äù to view the entire event payload.

### Funnel

Understand how the current page maps to your funnel:

- **Brand ID / FID / FNID**: Quick references for funnel resolution
- **Funnel Builder**: Open the funnel builder
- **Open Node**: Deep link to the node if a node code is available
- **Show Step**: Fallback deep link based on step information

<Warning>
If the page is not part of the current funnel, you'll see a banner explaining this. In that case, the funnel flow will not trigger from this page. See [Checkout Redirect Behavior](/funnels/checkout-redirect-behavior#default-redirect-behavior).
</Warning>

### Interactions

Track user interactions and form submissions:

- **Interaction list**: All tracked interactions on the page
- **Component details**: CCID, device type, and data
- **Focus functionality**: Highlight and scroll to interaction elements
- **Real-time updates**: See interactions as they happen

```javascript
// Focus a specific interaction element by CCID
debugWindow.focusOnElement('ccid-123');
```

### Components

Manage and debug page components:

#### Component Analysis
- **Component list**: All components with CIDs
- **Element details**: Tag names, classes, IDs
- **Position data**: X/Y coordinates and dimensions
- **Visual debugging**: Highlight components on the page

#### Component Actions
- **Focus components**: Highlight and scroll to specific components
- **Builder links**: Direct links to component builders
- **Batch highlighting**: Highlight all components simultaneously

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Example: Component Debugging
// Focus on a specific component
debugWindow.focusComponent('hero-section-123');

// Highlight all components
debugWindow.highlightAllComponents();

// Clear all highlights
debugWindow.clearHighlights();
```
</CodeGroup>

### Builders

Quick access to ElasticFunnels builder interfaces:

- **Page Builder**: Direct link to edit the current page
- **Events Builder**: Configure page events and funnels
- **Component Builder**: Edit specific components
- **Page Information**: Brand ID, Page ID, and FID details

### Console

Capture and monitor JavaScript console output:

- **Log capture**: Automatically captures console.log, console.warn, and console.error
- **Log filtering**: View logs by type (info, warning, error)
- **Test logging**: Generate test logs for debugging
- **Export capability**: Export logs for analysis

## Window Controls

- **Resize**: Drag the handle at the top edge of the panel to adjust height
- **Persist size**: The panel remembers its height between sessions
- **Open/Close**: Use the close button in the header, or press the hotkey again

## Usage Examples

### Debugging Page Events

1. **Open the Events tab** to see your funnel structure
2. **Review the event hierarchy** to understand the flow
3. **Check the console** for any error messages

### Testing Component Interactions

1. **Navigate to the Components tab**
2. **Click "Highlight All"** to see all tracked components
3. **Click "Focus" on specific components** to examine them
4. **Use the builder links** to edit components directly

### Exporting Debug Data

Two export options are available:

- **Header ‚Üí Export**: Downloads a JSON with device info, page events, interactions, and captured console logs
- **Page Events ‚Üí Export**: Downloads the backend-evaluated page events and their full contexts

## Advanced Features

### Data Export

The debug window can export comprehensive debugging data:

```javascript
// Export debugging data
debugWindow.exportData();
```

This creates a JSON file containing:
- Page configuration
- Event data
- Interaction logs
- Console logs

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Always test events** using the manual triggers before going live
2. **Use component highlighting** to verify tracking setup
3. **Monitor console logs** for JavaScript errors
4. **Export debug data** for troubleshooting complex issues

### Debugging Troubleshooting

1. **Check the Overview tab** for basic page information
2. **Verify event configuration** in the Events tab
3. **Ensure components are tracked** in the Components tab
4. **Review console logs** for error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Window Not Appearing

- **Check keyboard shortcut**: Ensure you're pressing **Ctrl+Shift+F12** (Windows/Linux) or **Command+Shift+F12** (Mac)
- **Verify page load**: Make sure the page has fully loaded
- **Check console**: Look for any JavaScript errors

### Components Not Highlighting

- **Refresh components**: Click the "Refresh" button in the Components tab
- **Check CID attributes**: Ensure components have proper `data-cid` attributes
- **Clear and re-highlight**: Use the clear and highlight buttons

### Funnel Links Not Appearing

- **Missing brand or funnel**: Ensure `Brand ID` and `FID` are present in the Overview tab
- **No node code available**: Only ‚ÄúOpen Node‚Äù is shown when a node code is detected; otherwise, ‚ÄúShow Step‚Äù is used
- **Page not in funnel**: Follow the banner link and review [Checkout Redirect Behavior](/funnels/checkout-redirect-behavior#default-redirect-behavior)

### Debug Window Opens on Wrong Domain

If you opened the Debug Window from the Page Builder and it appears on a different domain than the one you need:

<Note>
When you preview a page or open the Debugger, it opens on the first applicable domain. If your page isn‚Äôt assigned exclusively to a specific domain, it may open on the `*.elasticfunnels.io` subdomain. This is expected behavior. To preview on another domain, manually change the page URL‚Äôs domain and reopen the Debug Window there.
</Note>

1. In the already opened Debug Window, go to the **Overview** tab and copy the **Debug Key**
2. Navigate to the actual domain you want to debug
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + F12** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Shift + F12** (Mac) to open the Debug Window on that domain
4. Paste the **Debug Key** when prompted to attach the session to this domain

You can find the Debug Key in the **Overview** tab of the Debug Window.

<Warning>
The Debug Window only loads when you trigger the hotkey and does not affect page performance for visitors.
</Warning>
