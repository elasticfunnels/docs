  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Who Should Use These Tools

### Developers
- **Frontend developers** building custom ElasticFunnels implementations
- **JavaScript developers** working with page events and interactions
- **QA engineers** testing funnel functionality

### Marketers & Funnel Builders
- **Advanced marketers** who want to understand their funnel mechanics
- **Funnel optimizers** looking to improve performance
- **Technical marketers** troubleshooting conversion issues

### Support Teams
- **Technical support** helping customers debug issues
- **Implementation specialists** setting up complex funnels
- **Training teams** teaching advanced ElasticFunnels features

## Getting Started

The main debugging tool is the **Debug Window**, which provides:

- **Real-time monitoring** of page events and interactions
- **Visual component debugging** with highlighting and navigation
- **Performance metrics** including memory usage and load times
- **Mobile debugging** for mobile-specific issues
- **Console log capture** for JavaScript debugging
- **Direct builder links** for quick editing

<Note>
These are advanced tools intended for development and troubleshooting. Always test thoroughly before using on production pages with real traffic.
</Note>

## Common Use Cases

### Event Debugging
- Verify funnel events are configured correctly
- Test events without user interaction
- Debug event flow and data passing

### Component Troubleshooting
- Identify components not tracking properly
- Visual debugging of component placement
- Quick access to component builders

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor memory usage during page interactions
- Track load times and performance metrics
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### Mobile Debugging
- Debug mobile-specific issues
- Test touch interactions and mobile events
- Monitor mobile device capabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Use in development environments** before deploying to production
2. **Test all events manually** before going live
3. **Monitor performance regularly** during development
4. **Export debug data** for complex troubleshooting
5. **Clear highlights** after debugging to avoid visual clutter
