# Advanced Features & Testing

Unlock powerful features to optimize your funnels and maximize conversions.

## How do I add a split-test node for my headline or video?

**Description:** Learn how to test different versions (e.g., headlines or video content) within a single funnel step.

### AI Setup
1. You first need to add a "split test container" component where you want your split test content to show up
2. Then you go to the page events builder for that page
3. Click "Add Node"
4. Type a prompt like, "I want to split test video 1 and video 2 for people from the United States"
5. Add a "Split Test Component" node if needed, ensuring you've selected a Split Test Container

### Manual Setup
1. **Create the headline (or element) as a component:**
   - Right-click an element in the page builder and select "Create a new component," or build one from scratch
2. **Add a "Split Test Container" on the page and name it for reference**
3. **Go to the page events builder:**
   - Click "Add Node" and select "Split Test Component"
   - Select the container for the split test
   - Set the traffic percentage for each variant and choose the components to show
4. **Ensure connections:**
   - Connect the split test component node to the "entry node" or "script rule" node if not already connected

## How do I build an exit popup that triggers on exit intent?

**Description:** An exit popup appears when a user's mouse moves toward leaving the page, giving you a final opportunity to engage them.

### AI Setup
1. Go to the page events builder for the desired page
2. Click "Add Node"
3. Type a prompt, such as "Show [popup name] popup when a user tries to leave"

### Manual Setup
1. Go to "Pages" → "Advanced" → "Popups"
2. Click "Create Popup" and give it a name
3. Select a base template if needed
4. Return to the page events builder for the page
5. Click "Add Node" and select the "Exit Intent" node
6. Add a "Popup" node and connect it to the "Exit Intent" node

## How do I incorporate dynamic content blocks that change based on user behavior?

**Description:** Dynamic content automatically updates elements for scenarios like showing special pricing to certain affiliates or location-based offers.

### AI Setup
1. Go to the page events builder
2. Click "Add Node"
3. Type a prompt like, "Change content 'packages' for affiliate ID 100 with 'packages cheaper'"
4. Add a "Dynamic Container" node to ensure content replacement

### Manual Setup
1. **Wrap Components:** In the page builder, wrap the desired element (e.g., packages) in a "Dynamic Container" block. Name the block for easy reference
2. **Define Conditions:** In the page events builder, click "Add Node" and select "Script Rule." Specify conditions (e.g., affiliate ID, location)
3. **Set Up the Dynamic Container:** Add a "Dynamic Container" node and specify the content to replace when conditions are met
