# Products & Sales

Set up your products, configure purchase flows, and optimize your sales processes.

## How do I add a buy link for my products?

**Description:** Buy links let customers purchase products directly from your page.

### Add a Product
1. Go to "Products" → "Add Product"
2. Fill out all necessary information and define a product code
3. Include cost of goods if you want reporting

### Embedding the Buy Link
1. Create a link tag and insert `[BUY=product_code]` or `[UPSELL=product_code]`
2. You can pass more data, e.g., `[BUY=product_code cbfid=1234 extra=abcd]`

### Merchant Information
1. If you have a different code on Buygoods, Clickbank, or Digistore24, go to the "Merchant Information" tab
2. Associate the correct product ID from that platform

## How do I set up a redirect to an upsell page after a purchase?

**Description:** Redirecting users to an upsell page after purchase allows you to present additional offers or upgrades.

**Instructions:**
1. In your funnel builder, locate the page node where the purchase will occur
2. Add a "Purchase" node to the page node
3. After adding it, use a "Page" node to select an upsell page or a "Redirect to URL" node to enter the upsell URL
4. Connect the "Purchase" node to the next step
5. Save your funnel and perform a test purchase to ensure redirection works as expected

## How do I add custom attributes (like bonuses) to my product pages?

**Description:** Custom attributes let you include additional information (e.g., bonus URLs) on product pages.

### Create Custom Attributes
1. In "Products," select or create the product
2. Scroll to "Custom Attributes" and add a new key-value pair (e.g., "bonus_url" → "https://yourbonuslink")
3. Save your changes

### Use in Page Builder
1. Add a "Product Item" component to your page
2. In the properties tab, configure fields such as Product Type and Classification (e.g., Bonus)
3. To display attributes, add text or links using `{product.attributes.[attribute_name]}`, e.g., `{product.attributes.bonus_url}`
