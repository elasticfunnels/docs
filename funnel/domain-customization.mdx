# Domain & Customization

Brand your funnels with custom domains and personalized styling.

## How do I assign a custom domain to my funnel and enable SSL?

**Description:** Using a custom domain provides a branded URL and increases user trust through SSL encryption.

**Instructions:**
1. Go to the "Domains" section in your dashboard
2. Click "Add Domain" and switch to "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., example.com)
4. If you need SSL now, check "I want SSL for this domain"
5. If not, request SSL later from the domains list by clicking the options button and selecting "Request SSL" once the domain is validated
6. Associate the domain with a merchant to automatically update buy links (e.g., Buygoods, Clickbank, Digistore24)
7. Optionally, add reCAPTCHA site and private key for collection forms
8. Update your DNS with the required A record and TXT record for validation. Both must be added
9. You'll receive an email once validated. If you encounter issues, email support

## How do I adjust the look and feel (fonts, colors, etc.) of my funnel pages?
