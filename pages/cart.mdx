The cart shows what the visitor has added to their order: each item, quantity, price, and the total. It updates live when they add items or change quantities, without reloading the page.

## Adding a cart to your page

In the page builder you can add:

- **Cart** – A single cart block (list of items + total + checkout).
- **Cart Dropdown** – A “Cart” trigger (e.g. with item count) that opens a dropdown panel with the same cart inside. Handy in headers or sidebars.

Both use the same cart data; only the placement and layout differ.

### Where to find them

1. Open the **Elements** or **Blocks** panel.
2. In the **Cart** category, choose **Cart** or **Cart Dropdown**.
3. Drag the block onto your page where you want it (e.g. below the fold for Cart, in the top bar for Cart Dropdown).

The default Cart block already includes:

- A row per item (name, quantity controls, unit price, line total).
- A footer with **Total** and a **Checkout** link.

You can keep this layout or edit it (e.g. change labels, order of fields, or styling).

## What visitors see

- **Item name** – From your product/offer (e.g. “1 Bottle”).
- **Quantity** – Current quantity with **−** and **+** to decrease or increase.
- **Unit price** – Price per unit (e.g. “$69.00”).
- **Line total** – Price × quantity for that item (e.g. “$552.00”).
- **Cart total** – Sum of all line totals, shown in the footer (e.g. “Total: $552.00”).
- **Checkout** – Link to continue to checkout.

All of this updates automatically when they add to cart or change quantity.

## Customizing the cart layout

The cart is built from a **template**: you can change text, order of fields, and styling in the builder.

- **Totals** – The main total in the footer uses the variable **`[[ ef-cart.total ]]`**. You can move it or add labels; keep that variable where you want the total to appear.
- **Per-item row** – Each row can show:
  - **`[[ item.name ]]`** – Item name  
  - **`[[ item.quantity ]]`** – Quantity  
  - **`[[ item.price ]]`** – Unit price  
  - **`[[ item.total ]]`** – Line total (price × quantity)

If you add or reorder these, the cart will still update correctly as long as you keep the **`[[ ... ]]`** placeholders. For more on this syntax, see [Frontend Template Engine — Syntax](/frontend-template-engine/syntax).

## Cart dropdown

The **Cart Dropdown** block gives you:

- A **trigger** (e.g. “Cart” plus the number of items) that visitors click to open the cart.
- A **panel** that opens below (or in a suitable position) with the full cart inside: same items, quantities, totals, and checkout link.

Use it when you want the cart in a fixed spot (e.g. header) without taking space until the visitor opens it.

## Checkout link

The default **Checkout** button in the cart is a link (e.g. to `#checkout`). Configure its URL in the builder so it points to your actual checkout step or page. The cart only displays the link; checkout behavior is controlled by your funnel and checkout setup.

## Tips

- **Placement** – Put the cart or cart dropdown where visitors expect it (e.g. top-right for dropdown, above the fold for a full cart block).
- **Sticky / mobile** – You can place the cart in a sticky bar or in a mobile menu; the same block works anywhere.
- **Multiple carts** – You can add more than one cart or dropdown on a page; they all show the same cart data and stay in sync when the visitor changes quantity or adds items.
