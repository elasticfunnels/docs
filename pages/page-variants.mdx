Page variants allow you to create multiple versions of the same page for split testing, optimization, or different marketing campaigns.

## Creating Page Variants

### Add a New Variant
1. Go to **Pages** â†’ Select your page
2. Click **"Add Variant"** or **"Create Variant"**
3. The system automatically creates a new variant with the next number (V1, V2, V3, etc.)
4. Edit the new variant with your desired changes

### Variant Naming System
Elastic Funnels uses a **numerical system** instead of letters:
- **V1** - First variant (original)
- **V2** - Second variant  
- **V3** - Third variant
- And so on...

**Why numbers instead of letters?**
- **Clearer progression** - Easy to understand the sequence
- **No confusion** - No ambiguity about which comes first
- **Unlimited variants** - Can create as many as needed (V1, V2, V3...V100)

## Managing Variants

### Set Active Variant
1. **Select the variant** you want to make active
2. **Click "Set as Active"** or toggle the active status
3. **The URL updates** automatically to show the active version
4. **Version parameter** is added to the URL (e.g., `?v=2`)

### Version URL Structure
- **V1 (Default)**: `https://yoursite.com/page`
- **V2**: `https://yoursite.com/page?v=2`
- **V3**: `https://yoursite.com/page?v=3`

### Variant Status
Each variant has a status:
- **Active** - Currently serving to visitors
- **Draft** - Work in progress, not live
- **Paused** - Temporarily disabled
- **Archived** - Saved for reference but not active

## Split Testing with Variants

### Page-Level Split Testing
Use variants for A/B testing different page versions:

1. **Create multiple variants** with different content
2. **Set up split test** in Page Events or Funnel level
3. **Configure traffic distribution** (50/50, 70/30, etc.)
4. **Monitor performance** metrics for each variant

### Funnel-Level Integration
Variants work seamlessly with funnel split testing:
- **Split test node** can direct traffic to different variants
- **Purchase tracking** attributes conversions to specific variants
- **Analytics** show performance data for each variant

## Best Practices

### Variant Organization
- **Clear naming** - Use descriptive names beyond just V1, V2, V3
- **Version notes** - Document what changed in each variant
- **Purpose tracking** - Record why each variant was created
- **Performance baseline** - Always keep your original as a control

### Testing Strategy
- **Test one element** at a time for clear results
- **Significant changes** - Make meaningful differences between variants
- **Statistical significance** - Run tests long enough for reliable data
- **Document results** - Keep notes on what worked and what didn't

### Content Management
- **Consistent structure** - Keep similar layouts when possible
- **Asset management** - Organize images and videos for each variant
- **Mobile optimization** - Ensure all variants work on mobile devices
- **Loading speed** - Optimize each variant for fast loading

## Advanced Variant Usage

### Campaign-Specific Variants
Create variants for different marketing campaigns:
- **Traffic source optimization** - Different versions for different sources
- **Seasonal campaigns** - Holiday or event-specific versions
- **Geographic targeting** - Location-specific content
- **Device optimization** - Mobile vs desktop optimized versions

### Personalization
Use variants for personalized experiences:
- **Affiliate-specific** - Different versions for different affiliates
- **User segment** - Different content for different user types
- **Purchase history** - Different offers based on past purchases
- **Behavior-based** - Different content based on user actions

## Technical Implementation

### URL Parameters
Variants use the `v=` parameter:
- **Default behavior** - V1 loads without parameter
- **Explicit versions** - V2+ require `v=2`, `v=3`, etc.
- **SEO considerations** - Use canonical tags for duplicate content
- **Analytics tracking** - Ensure proper tracking for each variant

### Page Events Integration
Variants work with Page Events:
- **Query parameter conditions** - Can check for version parameter
- **Dynamic content** - Can load different content based on variant
- **Conditional logic** - Different actions for different variants

### Funnel Integration
Variants integrate with funnel flows:
- **Split test routing** - Direct traffic to specific variants
- **Purchase attribution** - Track which variant drove the conversion
- **Upsell sequences** - Different upsells based on variant performance

## Analytics and Reporting

### Performance Metrics
Track key metrics for each variant:
- **Conversion rate** - Percentage of visitors who convert
- **Revenue per visitor** - Average revenue generated
- **Bounce rate** - Percentage who leave immediately
- **Time on page** - How long visitors stay
- **Click-through rate** - Engagement with call-to-action buttons

### Comparison Tools
- **Side-by-side comparison** - Compare variant performance
- **Statistical significance** - Determine if differences are meaningful
- **Confidence intervals** - Understand the reliability of results
- **Performance trends** - Track improvement over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Variants not loading** - Check URL parameters and routing
- **Split tests not working** - Verify funnel or page event configuration
- **Analytics not tracking** - Ensure proper tracking setup for variants
- **Content not updating** - Clear cache and check variant status

### Testing Your Variants
1. **Direct URL access** - Test each variant URL directly
2. **Split test functionality** - Verify random distribution works
3. **Mobile testing** - Check all variants on mobile devices
4. **Cross-browser testing** - Ensure compatibility across browsers
5. **Performance testing** - Check loading speed for each variant

<Note>
Page variants are powerful for optimization, but avoid creating too many variants simultaneously. Focus on testing meaningful differences that could impact your conversion rates.
