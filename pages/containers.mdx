Containers are powerful page elements that control when and how content is displayed to visitors. They enable advanced functionality like conditional visibility, performance optimization, and personalized experiences.

## Overview

Containers wrap your page content and add special behaviors based on visitor actions, page events, or other conditions. Each container type serves a specific purpose in creating dynamic, high-performing funnels.

## Available Containers

### CTA Container

The **CTA Container** (Call-to-Action Container) is hidden by default and only appears when the CTA is triggered, typically used to reveal purchase buttons, pricing tables, or order forms after a visitor watches your Video Sales Letter (VSL).

**Key Features:**
- Hidden by default (`display: none`)
- Transforms to visible (`display: block`) when CTA is executed
- Can persist once triggered during the session
- Commonly contains buy buttons, pricing, checkout forms

**How to Trigger:**

The CTA can be executed in three ways:

1. **VSL CTA**: At a specific timestamp in your Video Sales Letter, you call `getStarted()` to trigger the CTA when that point is reached in the video
2. **Manual Button Click**: Add a button with click interaction that executes `getStarted()` JavaScript function
3. **Timed Event**: Use Page Events with JavaScript to execute `getStarted()` after a delay

**Example Button Click Setup:**

```javascript
// In Interactions Panel (Ctrl+I) on your button:
// Trigger: On Click
// Action: Execute JavaScript

getStarted();
```

**Common Use Cases:**
- Reveal order button after VSL completes
- Show pricing after engagement threshold
- Display purchase options on manual trigger
- Progressive disclosure of sales information

<Note>
The CTA Container uses the `getStarted()` global function which is available throughout your page. Once triggered, the container can remain visible for the visitor's session.
</Note>

### Hide on CTA Container

The **Hide on CTA Container** is the opposite of the CTA Container - it's visible by default and gets hidden when the CTA is executed.

**Key Features:**
- Visible by default
- Hides automatically when `getStarted()` is executed
- Useful for removing content that shouldn't appear with purchase options
- Often used in conjunction with CTA Container

**How It Works:**

When `getStarted()` is called (via VSL, button, or JavaScript), this container automatically hides while the CTA Container shows.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Hide video player when purchase form appears
- Remove promotional content after CTA
- Clear page space for checkout elements
- Create seamless transitions between sales pitch and purchase

**Example Pattern:**

```
Before CTA:
  ✓ Hide on CTA Container (visible) - Contains VSL video
  ✗ CTA Container (hidden) - Contains buy button

After CTA triggered:
  ✗ Hide on CTA Container (hidden) - VSL disappears
  ✓ CTA Container (visible) - Buy button appears
```

<Tip>
Use both containers together to create smooth transitions from your sales content to purchase forms. This creates a clean, focused buying experience.

### Merchant Container

The **Merchant Container** displays content conditionally based on the active payment processor (merchant) for the current page view.

**Key Features:**
- Shows content only for specific merchants
- Hides all non-matching merchant containers
- Can be set per domain or overridden in Page Events
- Useful for merchant-specific disclaimers, policies, and branding

**How Merchants Are Determined:**

1. **Domain-Level Setting**: Default merchant set in Domain settings
2. **Page Events Override**: Use the "Set Merchant" node in Page Events to override for specific conditions

**Supported Merchants:**
- Buygoods
- Clickbank
- Digistore24
- Other configured payment processors

**Configuration:**

1. **Add Merchant Container** to your page
2. **Select Merchant** from the container settings
3. **Add Content** specific to that merchant
4. **Repeat** for each merchant you want to support

**Example Scenario:**

You have different footer disclaimers specific to each merchant:

```
Page contains:
  - Merchant Container (Buygoods) → Buygoods-specific disclaimer and policies
  - Merchant Container (Clickbank) → Clickbank-specific disclaimer and policies
  - Merchant Container (Digistore24) → Digistore24-specific disclaimer and policies

When visitor arrives:
  - Domain merchant = Buygoods
  → Only Buygoods disclaimer displays

Override in Page Events:
  - Query Parameter (affiliate_id = 100)
  → Set Merchant to Clickbank
  → Only Clickbank disclaimer displays
```

**Common Use Cases:**
- Merchant-specific disclaimers and legal policies
- Payment processor-specific trust badges and seals
- Different refund policies based on merchant
- Merchant-specific support information and contact details
- Custom branding elements per merchant
- Merchant-specific terms and conditions

**Setting Merchant in Page Events:**

Use the **Set Merchant** node to dynamically change which merchant container displays:

1. Go to **Page Events** for your page
2. Add a condition (Query Parameter, Script Rule, etc.)
3. Connect to **Set Merchant** node
4. Select the merchant to activate
5. Merchant containers will show/hide accordingly

**Resetting Merchant:**

Use the **Clear Merchant** node to reset back to the domain's default merchant:

1. Add **Clear Merchant** node in Page Events
2. Connect it to a condition or event
3. When triggered, clears any session merchant override
4. Page returns to using the domain's default merchant

This is useful for:
- Resetting test merchants back to production
- Clearing affiliate-specific merchants after purchase
- Returning to default after special conditions expire

<Note>
If no merchant is set (neither at domain level nor via Page Events), merchant containers will not display. Ensure you have a default merchant configured.
</Note>

### Split Test Container

The **Split Test Container** allows you to run A/B tests on specific sections of your page through Page Events.

**Key Features:**
- Test different content variations
- Controlled through Page Events
- Tracks performance of each variant
- Can split test any page element or section

**How to Use:**

1. **Add Split Test Container** to your page
2. **Configure in Page Events**:
   - Add Split Test Component node
   - Set traffic distribution percentages
   - Connect to Dynamic Container nodes to load different content
3. **Track Results** in Analytics

**Common Use Cases:**
- Test different headlines
- Compare pricing presentations
- Test different images or videos
- Optimize form layouts

**Best Practices:**
- Test one element at a time
- Run tests long enough for statistical significance
- Track meaningful conversion goals
- Document your test results

<Tip>

### Lazy Load Container

The **Lazy Load Container** defers loading of content inside it until the visitor scrolls to that section of the page.

**Key Features:**
- Improves initial page load performance
- Loads content "just in time" when visitor scrolls near it
- Reduces bandwidth for content visitors never see
- Seamless loading experience

**How It Works:**

1. Page loads with empty lazy load containers
2. Visitor scrolls down the page
3. When container enters viewport (or approaches it), content loads
4. Content appears smoothly without page disruption

**What to Lazy Load:**
- Below-the-fold content
- Large images or videos
- Comment sections
- Secondary information
- Resource-heavy widgets or embeds

**What NOT to Lazy Load:**
- Above-the-fold content
- Critical purchase buttons
- Forms that need immediate interaction
- Content needed for SEO

**Performance Tips:**
- Use for content below the fold only
- Combine with image optimization
- Test on slow connections
- Monitor Core Web Vitals impact

<Warning>
Don't lazy load critical conversion elements like buy buttons or lead capture forms. Visitors should be able to interact with these immediately.
</Warning>

## Container Combination Patterns

### Progressive Sales Flow

Combine multiple containers for a complete sales experience:

```
Initial Page Load:
  ✓ Hide on CTA Container
    - VSL video
    - Sales copy
  ✗ CTA Container (hidden)
    - Pricing
    - Buy button

After VSL triggers CTA:
  ✗ Hide on CTA Container (hidden)
  ✓ CTA Container (visible)
    - Pricing
    - Buy button
    ✓ Merchant Container (Buygoods)
      - Buygoods disclaimer
    ✗ Merchant Container (Clickbank) - hidden
```

### Performance-Optimized Page

Use lazy loading for better page speed:

```
Above the fold:
  - Hero section (loads immediately)
  - VSL player (loads immediately)
  - CTA button (loads immediately)

Below the fold (lazy loaded):
  ✓ Lazy Load Container
    - Testimonials section
    - FAQ accordion
    - Detailed features
    - Footer content
```

### Dynamic Merchant Selection

Adapt disclaimers and policies based on traffic source:

```
Page Events Flow:
  1. On Page Load
  2. Query Parameter Condition (source = partner1)
     → Set Merchant to Buygoods
  3. Query Parameter Condition (source = partner2)
     → Set Merchant to Clickbank
  4. Default
     → Domain default merchant

Result:
  - Only matching merchant container displays
  - Visitor sees appropriate disclaimers and policies
```

## Best Practices

### Container Organization

1. **Clear Naming**: Name containers descriptively in the page builder
2. **Document Logic**: Note which containers work together
3. **Test All Paths**: Verify all show/hide conditions work correctly
4. **Consider Mobile**: Ensure container behaviors work on all devices

### Performance Guidelines

1. **Lazy Load Wisely**: Use for below-fold content only
2. **Minimize Nesting**: Don't nest containers unnecessarily
3. **Test Load Times**: Monitor impact on page speed
4. **Optimize Content**: Compress images and minimize resources inside containers

### User Experience

1. **Smooth Transitions**: Avoid jarring content shifts when containers appear
2. **Visual Feedback**: Let users know when content is loading
3. **Fallback Content**: Have defaults for when conditions aren't met
4. **Test Edge Cases**: What happens if no merchant is set? Test it.

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Simple**: Add containers one at a time
2. **Test Immediately**: Verify each container works before adding more
3. **Use Preview Mode**: Test without affecting live traffic
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache when testing changes

## Troubleshooting

### CTA Container Not Showing

**Symptoms**: CTA container remains hidden after trigger

**Possible Causes:**
- `getStarted()` not being called correctly
- JavaScript errors preventing execution
- Container selector issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify button click triggers `getStarted()`
3. Test VSL CTA timestamp is reached
4. Confirm container has correct ID/class

### Merchant Container Not Displaying

**Symptoms**: No merchant containers showing

**Possible Causes:**
- No merchant set at domain level
- No merchant selected in Page Events
- Merchant ID mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Check domain settings for default merchant
2. Verify Set Merchant node in Page Events
3. Confirm merchant containers have correct merchant assigned
4. Check browser console for errors

### Lazy Load Issues

**Symptoms**: Content not loading when scrolling

**Possible Causes:**
- Container too small to trigger
- JavaScript not initializing properly
- Content inside container has errors

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure container has minimum height
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test without lazy loading first
4. Verify content loads normally outside container

### Multiple Containers Conflicting

**Symptoms**: Unexpected show/hide behavior

**Possible Causes:**
- Overlapping container logic
- Multiple merchants set incorrectly
- CTA and Hide on CTA not paired properly

**Solutions:**
1. Review Page Events flow carefully
2. Test each container individually
3. Check for conflicting JavaScript
4. Simplify logic and add complexity gradually
