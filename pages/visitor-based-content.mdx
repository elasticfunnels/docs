Content Visibility Control allows you to show different content to different visitors based on their whitelisting status. This is useful for personalizing experiences, protecting sensitive content from competitors, and showing appropriate content to different visitor segments.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Whitelisted Container"
    icon="eye"
  >
    Contains full content visible only to whitelisted visitors (VSL, sales pages, etc.)
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Non-Whitelisted Container"
    icon="eye-slash"
  >
    Contains standard content visible to all non-whitelisted visitors (TSL, basic info)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

Content Visibility Control uses a whitelisting system to determine which visitors see which content. When a visitor is whitelisted, they see the full content in Whitelisted Containers. Non-whitelisted visitors see the standard content in Non-Whitelisted Containers.

<Info>
Both container types can exist on the same page. The system automatically shows the appropriate container based on the visitor's whitelist status.
</Info>

## Content Containers

### Whitelisted Container

The **Whitelisted Container** displays content exclusively to whitelisted visitors.

**Features:**
- Contains **full content** (VSL, sales pages, complete offers)
- Only visible to whitelisted visitors
- Used for personalized visitor experiences
- Perfect for protecting sensitive information

**Use Cases:**
- Full sales presentations
- Complete product details
- Exclusive offers and pricing
- Detailed testimonials and case studies

### Non-Whitelisted Container

The **Non-Whitelisted Container** displays standard content to visitors who aren't whitelisted.

**Features:**
- Contains **standard content** (TSL, basic landing pages)
- Always visible to non-whitelisted visitors
- Default content for visitors without whitelist status
- Ensures all visitors see appropriate content

**Use Cases:**
- Basic landing pages
- General information
- Standard pricing displays
- Simplified content versions

## Content Display Methods

Choose the method that best fits your needs:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Container-Based"
    icon="layout"
    href="#container-based-display"
  >
    **Recommended** - Use both containers on the same page for easy management
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Page Loading"
    icon="file"
    href="#page-loading-method"
  >
    Load entirely different pages based on visitor status
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Redirect Method"
    icon="arrow-right"
    href="#redirect-method"
  >
    Redirect users to different URLs based on their status
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Container-Based Display

<Note>
This is the recommended method for most use cases.
</Note>

Use Whitelisted and Non-Whitelisted containers on the same page:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Both versions exist on the same URL
- ✅ Easy to understand and manage
- ✅ Clear separation of standard vs full content
- ✅ No confusion about redirect destinations
- ✅ Better SEO and link management

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Add Whitelisted Container** to your page
2. **Add your full content** (VSL, sales copy, etc.) inside this container
3. **Add Non-Whitelisted Container** to your page  
4. **Add standard content** (TSL, basic info) inside this container
5. **Configure whitelisting rules** in Page Events (see Whitelisting section below)

### Page Loading Method

Load entirely different pages based on visitor status:

**When to use:**
- Completely different page layouts needed
- Complex content differences
- Multiple page variants
- Different design systems per visitor type

**Setup:**

1. Create separate pages for different visitor segments
2. Use **"Load Page"** node in Page Events
3. Connect to query parameter conditions

<Tip>
This method is useful when you need dramatically different layouts or when managing multiple page variants.
</Tip>

### Redirect Method

Redirect users to different URLs based on their status:

**When to use:**
- External landing pages
- Different domains for different content
- Integration with existing systems
- Third-party platform requirements

**Setup:**

1. Configure redirect rules in Page Events
2. Use **"Redirect to URL"** node
3. Connect to whitelisting conditions

## Whitelisting Visitors

Whitelisting determines which visitors see full content. There are three main methods:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Domain-Level"
    icon="globe"
    href="#domain-level-whitelisting"
  >
    Automatically whitelist all visitors to a specific domain
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Query Parameter"
    icon="link"
    href="#query-parameter-whitelisting"
  >
    Whitelist visitors based on URL parameters (most common)
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Session-Based"
    icon="clock"
    href="#session-based-whitelisting"
  >
    Whitelisting persists across page navigation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Domain-Level Whitelisting

Automatically whitelist all visitors to a specific domain:

**Setup:**

1. Go to **Domains** → **Edit Domain**
2. Enable **"Whitelist all visitors"**
3. All visitors to this domain will automatically see full content

**Use case:** When you have a separate domain for different visitor segments or traffic sources

**Example:**
- `main-site.com` - Whitelisted (shows full content)
- `review-site.com` - Non-whitelisted (shows standard content)

### Query Parameter Whitelisting

<Note>
This is the most common method for whitelisting visitors.
</Note>

Whitelist visitors based on URL parameters:

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to **Page Events** for the specific page you want to configure
2. From the **"On Page Loaded"** node, drag a new **"Query Parameter Condition"** node
3. Configure the parameter you want to check (e.g., `vtID` equals `k`)
4. From the **"Query Parameter Condition"** node, drag a **"Whitelist Visitor"** node
5. Visitors with the correct parameter will be whitelisted for their entire session

**Example URL:**
```
https://yoursite.com/page?vtID=k
```

**Common Parameters:**
- `vtID=k` - General whitelisting
- `access=premium` - Premium content access
- `preview=true` - Preview mode

<Tip>
You can also use **"Mark Visitor as Not Whitelisted"** to remove whitelist status under specific conditions.
</Tip>

### Session-Based Whitelisting

Once a visitor is whitelisted, they remain whitelisted for their entire session:

**Features:**
- **Persistent:** Whitelisting survives page navigation
- **Session-wide:** Applies to all pages in the funnel
- **Automatic:** No need to re-whitelist on each page
- **Cookie-based:** Uses session cookies to maintain status

**How it works:**
1. Visitor arrives with whitelisting parameter
2. System whitelists visitor for the session
3. Visitor navigates to other pages
4. Whitelist status persists automatically
5. Status expires when session ends

## Advanced Whitelisting Scenarios

### Conditional Whitelisting

Use **"Mark visitor as not whitelisted"** if you need to:

- Remove whitelist status under certain conditions
- Require the parameter on every page visit
- Reset whitelisting for testing
- Create time-limited access

**Example Flow:**
```
Page Load → Query Parameter (vtID=k) → Whitelist Visitor
         → Query Parameter (reset=true) → Mark as Not Whitelisted
```

### Multiple Whitelisting Methods

You can combine different whitelisting methods for complex scenarios:

**Combinations:**
- Domain-level + Query parameters
- Different parameters for different content
- Conditional logic based on traffic source
- Geographic-based whitelisting

**Example:**
```
Domain: main-site.com (auto-whitelisted)
  → Query Parameter (source=partner) → Additional premium content
  → Query Parameter (source=competitor) → Mark as Not Whitelisted
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Whitelisting Not Working">
    **Solution:** Check query parameter spelling and case sensitivity. Parameters are case-sensitive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Not Switching">
    **Solution:** Verify container names and Page Events connections. Check browser console for errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Issues">
    **Solution:** Clear browser cache and cookies for testing. Test in incognito mode.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parameter Not Recognized">
    **Solution:** Ensure the parameter is set correctly in Page Events and matches the URL exactly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Testing Your Setup

Follow these steps to verify your Content Visibility Control setup:

1. **Test Standard Content**
   - Visit your page without whitelisting parameter
   - Should see standard content (Non-Whitelisted Container)

2. **Test Full Content**
   - Add the whitelisting parameter to URL (e.g., `?vtID=k`)
   - Should see full content (Whitelisted Container)

3. **Test Session Persistence**
   - Navigate to other pages in the funnel
   - Should remain whitelisted across pages

4. **Test in Incognito Mode**
   - Verify session behavior without cached data
   - Test parameter recognition

<Tip>
Use browser developer tools to inspect cookies and session data when troubleshooting whitelisting issues.
