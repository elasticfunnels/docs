A dedicated landing page helps you showcase your product or service effectively to visitors.

1. Select "Pages" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create Page," then name it
3. Choose a domain if you want the page to be available only on that domain (otherwise, it's available on all project domains)
4. Pick a "Page Type": visual builder or code editor (for more customization, requires programming knowledge)
5. In the visual builder, drag and drop elements (text, images, forms, etc.) to design your layout
6. Save your page and preview it
7. You can publish it immediately or keep it as a draft

## Page Builder Tips

- **Start with a template** if available to speed up the process
- **Keep it simple** - focus on one main call-to-action
- **Use compelling headlines** that clearly communicate your value proposition
- **Include social proof** like testimonials or reviews
- **Optimize for mobile** - preview on different screen sizes
- **Test loading speed** - optimize images and minimize elements

## Best Practices

- Keep your page focused on a single goal
- Use contrasting colors for your call-to-action buttons
- Include trust signals (security badges, testimonials, etc.)
- Write clear, benefit-focused copy
- Use high-quality images that support your message
