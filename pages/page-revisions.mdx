Page revisions automatically save your work as you edit, so you never lose your changes. You can view your revision history and restore any previous version at any time.

## How It Works

**Your work is protected automatically.** Here's what happens behind the scenes:

- **While you edit** - Your changes are saved as a draft, separate from your live page
- **When you publish** - A backup of your previous version is saved before the new one goes live
- **Your history is kept** - All your saved versions are preserved so you can go back anytime

<Note>
Visitors always see your published page. Your drafts and edits are private until you choose to publish.
</Note>

## Viewing Your Revision History

To see previous versions of your page:

1. Open your page in the builder
2. Click **"Revisions"** or the history icon
3. Browse your saved versions by date
4. Click any revision to preview it

## Restoring a Previous Version

Found a version you want to bring back? You have two options:

### Replace Your Current Page

Use this when you want to undo recent changes:

1. Select the revision you want
2. Click **"Restore to Current"**
3. Review the restored content in the builder
4. Publish when you're ready

<Warning>
This will replace your current draft. Save any work you want to keep before restoring.
</Warning>

### Create a New Page from a Revision

Use this when you want to keep your current page and also use an older version:

1. Select the revision you want
2. Click **"Restore to New Page"**
3. Give the new page a name
4. Edit and publish independently

This is great for:
- Recovering content you deleted
- Creating a variant based on an older design
- Comparing different versions side by side

## What Gets Saved

Every revision captures your complete page:

- All your content and text
- Styling and layout
- Any interactions or animations you've added
- Page settings and configuration

<Note>
Images and videos are stored separately. If you delete media from your library, it may affect how older revisions display.
</Note>

## Discarding Your Draft

Changed your mind about recent edits? You can discard your draft to go back to the published version:

1. Click **"Discard Changes"** or **"Discard Draft"**
2. Confirm the action
3. Your page returns to the last published version

Your revision history and published page stay intact—only the current draft is removed.

## Tips for Working with Revisions

- **Save often** - Your work is auto-saved, but clicking save ensures nothing is lost
- **Publish when ready** - Don't leave important changes sitting in draft too long
- **Check history before big changes** - Know what version you can restore to if needed
- **Use "Restore to New Page"** for experiments - Keep your original safe while trying new ideas

## Troubleshooting

### My changes aren't saving

- Check your internet connection
- Look for any error messages
- Try clicking the save button manually
- Refresh the page and try again

### I can't find a revision I'm looking for

- Make sure you're viewing the correct page
- Check if you're looking at the right variant (each variant has its own history)
- Revisions are listed by date—scroll through the list

### A restored revision looks different than expected

- Images may have been updated or removed since that version was saved
- External fonts or resources may have changed
- Try previewing in the same browser you originally used
