## TLDR

**Quick Summary**: Ad spend metrics help you measure the effectiveness and profitability of your advertising campaigns. These metrics show how much you're spending, what you're getting in return, and where to optimize your budget.

**Most Important**: Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), and Cost Per Click (CPC) are your core advertising performance indicators.

**Bottom Line**: Profitable advertising requires ROAS above 3:1 minimum, with 4:1+ being good performance. Monitor these metrics to optimize budget allocation and campaign performance.

## Core Ad Spend Metrics

### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

**What it is**: Revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising

**How it's calculated**: Revenue ÷ Ad Spend

**Example**: $5,000 revenue from $1,000 ad spend = 5:1 ROAS

**Why it's crucial**:
- Shows direct profitability of ad campaigns
- Helps determine budget allocation
- Compares performance across different channels
- Guides scaling decisions

**Benchmarks**:
- 3:1 ROAS: Break-even point (minimum)
- 4:1 ROAS: Good performance
- 6:1+ ROAS: Excellent performance
- 8:1+ ROAS: Outstanding performance

**Industry variations**:
- E-commerce: 4:1 - 6:1 typical
- SaaS: 3:1 - 5:1 typical
- High-ticket items: 2:1 - 4:1 acceptable
- Low-margin products: 6:1+ needed

- Optimize bidding strategies
