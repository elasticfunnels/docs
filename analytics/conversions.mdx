## TLDR

**Quick Summary**: Conversion metrics measure how well your funnels turn visitors into customers and revenue. Key metrics include conversion rate, average order value (AOV), earnings per click (EPC), and customer lifetime value.

**Most Important**: Conversion Rate (% of visitors who buy), AOV (average purchase amount), and EPC (revenue per visitor) are your core performance indicators.

**Bottom Line**: Higher conversion rates and AOV mean more revenue from the same traffic. Focus on these metrics to optimize your funnel performance.

## Core Conversion Metrics

### Conversion Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of visitors who complete a purchase

**How it's calculated**: (Number of customers ÷ Number of visitors) × 100

**Example**: 1,000 visitors, 50 purchases = 5% conversion rate

**Why it matters**: 
- Your most important metric for funnel performance
- Small improvements have big revenue impact
- Industry average is typically 1-3% for e-commerce

**Good benchmarks**:
- 1-2%: Needs improvement
- 3-5%: Good performance  
- 5%+: Excellent performance

---

### Sessions vs Customers

**Sessions**: Total number of website visits (including repeat visitors)

**Customers**: Unique individuals who made a purchase

**Why both matter**: Sessions show traffic volume, customers show actual buyers. The ratio between them is your conversion rate.

---

### Average Order Value (AOV)

**What it is**: The average amount customers spend per purchase

**How it's calculated**: Total revenue ÷ Number of orders

**Example**: $10,000 revenue from 100 orders = $100 AOV

**Why it matters**:
- Directly impacts revenue without needing more traffic
- Easier to increase than conversion rate
- Shows effectiveness of upsells and cross-sells

**Ways to improve**:
- Add upsells and cross-sells
- Bundle products together
- Offer volume discounts
- Increase product prices strategically

## Revenue Metrics

### Gross Revenue

**What it is**: Total sales amount before any deductions

**Includes**: All product sales, shipping, taxes, and fees

**Use for**: Understanding total business volume

---

### Net Revenue

**What it is**: Revenue after deductions like refunds, chargebacks, and fees

**More accurate for**: Actual money you keep from sales

**Why it's important**: Shows true business performance after costs

---

### Earnings Per Click (EPC)

**What it is**: Average revenue generated per website visitor

**How it's calculated**: Total revenue ÷ Total clicks/visits

**Example**: $5,000 revenue from 1,000 clicks = $5.00 EPC

**Why it's crucial**:
- Shows true value of your traffic
- Helps determine profitable advertising spend
- Compares performance across different traffic sources

**Types**:
- **Gross EPC**: Before any deductions
- **Net EPC**: After refunds and fees (more accurate)

## Advanced Metrics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**What it is**: How much you spend to acquire one customer

**How it's calculated**: Total marketing spend ÷ Number of new customers

**Example**: $1,000 ad spend, 50 new customers = $20 CAC

**Why it matters**: Must be less than customer lifetime value to be profitable

---

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**What it is**: Total revenue a customer generates over their relationship with you

**Includes**: Initial purchase + repeat purchases + upsells

**Key ratio**: LTV should be 3-5x higher than CAC for healthy business

## Funnel Performance Metrics

### Add to Cart Rate

**What it is**: Percentage of visitors who add products to their cart

**Shows**: Interest level in your products

**Typical range**: 5-15% depending on industry

---

### Cart Abandonment Rate

**What it is**: Percentage of people who add to cart but don't complete purchase

**How it's calculated**: (Carts created - Purchases) ÷ Carts created × 100

**Industry average**: 60-70% (meaning 30-40% complete purchase)

---

### Checkout Completion Rate

**What it is**: Percentage of people who complete purchase after starting checkout

**Target**: 85%+ completion rate

**Low rates indicate**: Checkout process issues, unexpected costs, or technical problems

## Understanding Your Data

### What Good Performance Looks Like
**High-performing funnels typically have**:
- Conversion rate: 3-8%
- AOV: $75-200+ (varies by industry)
- EPC: $2-10+ 
- Cart completion: 85%+
- ROAS: 4:1 or higher

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Conversion rate under 1%
- High traffic but low revenue
- Declining AOV over time
- High refund rates
- Poor mobile performance

### Seasonal Considerations
- Holiday seasons typically show higher AOV
- Summer months may have lower conversion rates
- Back-to-school and Black Friday are peak periods
- Plan campaigns around these patterns

## Improving Your Metrics

### Boost Conversion Rate
- Improve page load speed
- Add customer testimonials and reviews
- Simplify checkout process
- Test different headlines and offers

## Tracking and Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring
Check these metrics daily:
- Conversion rate
- Revenue
- Traffic volume
- Major funnel steps

### Weekly Analysis

## Common Questions

### "What's a good conversion rate for my industry?"
Conversion rates vary widely by industry, traffic source, and price point. Focus on improving your own baseline rather than comparing to others.

### "Should I focus on more traffic or better conversion rate?"
Generally, improving conversion rate is more cost-effective than buying more traffic. A 1% improvement in conversion rate often has bigger impact than 20% more traffic.

### "How do I know if my AOV is good?"
Compare your AOV to your customer acquisition cost. If AOV is 3-5x higher than CAC, you're in good shape.

### "Why do my metrics fluctuate so much?"
Daily fluctuations are normal due to traffic patterns, seasonality, and external factors. Focus on weekly and monthly trends instead of daily changes.
