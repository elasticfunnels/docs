<Warning>
**Player Compatibility Notice**: Video tracking accuracy depends on your video player implementation. Some players may not properly track all metrics or may have limited support.

**Known Limitations**:
- **vTurb V2**: Only partially supported - some metrics may not track accurately
- **Custom players**: Must implement standard video events and have `video` tag name.

**Recommendation**: Test your specific player setup to verify which metrics are accurately tracked before relying on the data for optimization decisions.
</Warning>

## TLDR

**Quick Summary**: Video metrics help you understand how users interact with video content in your funnels. These metrics work with various video players and provide insights into engagement, completion rates, and viewing behavior.

**Most Important**: Video Play Rate, Video Completion Rate, and Average Watch Time are your core video performance indicators.

**Bottom Line**: Higher video engagement typically leads to better conversion rates. Monitor these metrics to optimize your video content and placement.

**Player Compatibility**: These metrics work with most modern video players including HTML5, Vimeo, YouTube, Wistia, and custom players that support standard video events.

## Core Video Engagement Metrics

### Video Play Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of visitors who start playing your video

**How it's calculated**: (Video Play Sessions ÷ Total Sessions) × 100

**Example**: 500 video plays from 1,000 sessions = 50% play rate

**Why it matters**:
- Shows how compelling your video thumbnail and placement are
- Indicates initial user interest in your content
- Helps optimize video positioning and preview images

**Good benchmarks**:
- 30-50%: Good performance
- 50-70%: Excellent performance
- 70%+: Outstanding performance

**Player requirements**: Requires video player to fire 'play' events

---

### Video Completion Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of video viewers who watch the entire video

**How it's calculated**: (Video Completion Sessions ÷ Video Play Sessions) × 100

**Example**: 200 completions from 500 plays = 40% completion rate

**Why it matters**:
- Measures content quality and engagement
- Indicates if video length is appropriate
- Shows effectiveness of your video content

**Good benchmarks**:
- 20-40%: Typical performance
- 40-60%: Good performance
- 60%+: Excellent performance

**Player requirements**: Requires video player to fire 'ended' or completion events

---

### Average Video Watch Time

**What it is**: The average amount of time users spend watching your video

**How it's calculated**: Total Video Watch Time ÷ Video Sessions

**Example**: 5,000 seconds total watch time from 100 sessions = 50 seconds average

**Why it matters**:
- Shows actual engagement level with your content
- Helps identify optimal video length
- Indicates where viewers typically drop off

**Optimization tips**:
- Hook viewers in the first 10 seconds
- Keep key messages early in the video
- Test different video lengths
- Add captions for better accessibility

**Player requirements**: Requires video player to track time watched accurately

---

## Advanced Video Metrics

### Video Unmute Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of video viewers who unmute the video (for autoplay videos)

**How it's calculated**: (Video Unmute Sessions ÷ Video Play Sessions) × 100

**Why it matters**:
- Critical for autoplay video strategies
- Shows active engagement vs passive viewing
- Helps optimize audio content and captions

**Good benchmarks**:
- 10-20%: Typical for autoplay videos
- 20-30%: Good performance
- 30%+: Excellent performance

**Player requirements**: Requires video player to track mute/unmute events

---

### Video CTA Show Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of video sessions where a call-to-action is displayed

**How it's calculated**: (Video CTA Shows ÷ Video Sessions) × 100

**Why it matters**:
- Measures CTA visibility and timing
- Helps optimize when CTAs appear
- Shows potential conversion opportunities

**Optimization strategies**:
- Show CTAs at optimal engagement points
- Test different CTA timing
- A/B test CTA designs and messaging

**Player requirements**: Requires custom implementation to track CTA displays

---

### Total Video Watch Time

**What it is**: The cumulative time all users spend watching your video content

**Use for**:
- Understanding overall content consumption
- Calculating average watch times
- Measuring total engagement volume

**Why it's valuable**:
- Shows aggregate content value
- Helps justify video production costs
- Indicates content popularity trends

---

## Video Session Metrics

### Video Sessions

**What it is**: Total number of sessions where video content was accessed

**Different from**: Video plays (some sessions may not result in plays)

**Use for**:
- Understanding video exposure
- Calculating play rates
- Measuring video page traffic

---

### Video Play Sessions

**What it is**: Number of sessions where users actually started playing the video

**Why track separately**: Distinguishes between video exposure and actual engagement

**Use for**:
- Calculating completion rates
- Understanding true video engagement
- Optimizing video placement and thumbnails

---

### Video Completion Sessions

**What it is**: Number of sessions where users watched the video to completion

**Critical for**:
- Measuring content effectiveness
- Understanding user commitment
- Optimizing video length and content
