## Core Tracking Metrics

### Sessions

**What it is**: Individual visits to your website or funnel, regardless of duration

**How it's tracked**: Unique session identifiers that expire after inactivity

**Example**: A user visits your site, browses for 10 minutes, leaves, then returns 2 hours later = 2 sessions

**Why it matters**:
- Foundation metric for calculating rates and averages
- Shows traffic volume and user interest
- Used to calculate conversion rates and engagement metrics

**Technical details**:
- Session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity (configurable)
- New session starts with each new visit
- Cross-device sessions may be counted separately

---

### Page Views

**What it is**: Total number of pages viewed across all sessions

**How it's tracked**: Each page load or route change triggers a page view event

**Different from sessions**: Multiple page views can occur within a single session

**Why it's valuable**:
- Shows content consumption patterns
- Indicates user engagement depth
- Helps identify popular content
- Used for calculating pages per session

**Optimization insights**:
- High page views per session indicate good engagement
- Low page views may suggest navigation issues
- Track which pages drive the most views

---

### Unique Clicks

**What it is**: Number of distinct sessions that resulted in at least one click

**How it's calculated**: Cardinality count of unique session IDs with click events

**Different from total clicks**: Counts each session only once, regardless of multiple clicks

**Why it's important**:
- Shows actual user engagement vs bot traffic
- More accurate than total clicks for engagement analysis
- Better metric for calculating click-through rates

**Use cases**:
- Measuring campaign effectiveness

- Helps optimize user flow
- Measures engagement quality

**Optimization tactics**:
- Test different CTA designs
- Improve CTA placement
- Optimize messaging and copy

- Measures funnel effectiveness
- Predicts conversion potential

**Typical ranges**: 5-15% depending on industry and traffic source

**Improvement strategies**:
- Optimize product presentation
- Improve pricing strategy
- Add social proof elements
